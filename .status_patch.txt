< **Next Agent**: planner (for Milestone 7: Integration Testing & Playtesting)
< **Handoff Context**: Milestones 1-6 COMPLETE. 264 tests passing. UI/UX Polish complete with phase transitions, evidence-hypothesis linking, dramatic feedback animations, and full accessibility support. Ready for Integration Testing & Playtesting.

> **Next Agent**: User decision (review GAME_DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md, then possibly planner for PRP creation)
> **Handoff Context**: Critical game design analysis complete. GAME_DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md identifies root cause of "broken" investigation phase (lack of player agency, missing feedback loops) and provides 5 prioritized solutions with concrete implementation details. User should review analysis and decide whether to proceed with recommended fixes or continue with Milestone 7.
