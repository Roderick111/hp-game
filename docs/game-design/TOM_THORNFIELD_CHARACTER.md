## Background & Trauma

### The Replacement Child

**Family History:**
- **Older brother:** Samuel Thornfield (died 1997, age 19)
  - Brilliant Auror trainee
  - Died heroically during Battle of Department of Mysteries
  - Posthumously awarded Order of Merlin, Third Class
  - Ministry memorial plaque: "Samuel Thornfield - Exemplary Service"

- **Tom's childhood:** Born 1984, age 7 when Samuel died
  - Parents (Robert and Helen Thornfield) never recovered from loss
  - Family home became shrine to Samuel
  - Every dinner: "Samuel would have..."
  - Every disappointment: "Samuel never..."
  - Tom's achievements compared unfavorably: "Good, but Samuel did it at age 12"

**The Core Wound:**
```
Not "I need to prove I'm good enough."
But "I need to prove I'm Samuel."

Because being Tom was never enough.
```

### The Impossible Standard

**Samuel's legend (inflated by grief):**
- Never made mistakes (actually did, parents forgot)
- Always confident (actually struggled, parents romanticized)
- Natural Auror (actually studied obsessively, parents idealized)
- Died a hero (true, but complicated - Sam was terrified, fought anyway)

**Tom's reality:**
- Received Samuel's wand (14th birthday, "carry on his legacy")
- Wore Samuel's old robes (Hogwarts, "they still have magic in them")
- Chose Samuel's career (Auror Academy, "make him proud")
- Adopted Samuel's confidence (false, desperate, destructive)

**The fatal belief:**
"Samuel never said 'I don't know.' If I do, I'm not worthy of his memory."

---

### Auror Academy & Unraveling

**Joined:** 1992 (age 18, fresh from Hogwarts)
**Motivation:** Continue Samuel's legacy
**Problem:** Wasn't Samuel

**The gap:**
- Samuel: natural instincts + studied hard = real competence
- Tom: no instincts + fake confidence = masked incompetence

**The spiral:**
1. Struggled with investigations (normal for trainee)
2. Couldn't admit struggling ("Samuel wouldn't struggle")
3. Pretended he understood when he didn't
4. Made wrong conclusions confidently
5. When corrected, doubled down ("Samuel was never wrong")
6. Failed Case #1, got Marcus Bellweather imprisoned
7. Failed Case #2, publicly humiliated but couldn't admit error
8. Moody tried to fail him out (saw the danger)
9. Tom complained to Ministry (family name + Samuel's legacy = reinstated)
10. Died on Case #3 (couldn't admit "I don't know if this is safe")

---

### The Three Cases

#### Case #1: The Poisoning (Marcus Bellweather)

**The Crime:** Ministry official poisoned at dinner party

**The Investigation:**
- Evidence pointed multiple directions
- Tom fixated early: estranged son (Marcus Bellweather)
- Marcus had public argument with victim week prior
- But: Marcus had alibi (St. Mungo's medical records, time-stamped)

**Tom's reasoning:**
```
"The son is the obvious suspect. Motive, opportunity, hostile relationship.
The alibi? Records can be faked. He has connections at St. Mungo's.
I'm SURE it's him. Samuel would see through the alibi deception."
```

**Reality:**
- Alibi was legitimate (magical timestamp, unfakeable)
- Actual killer: Secretary (financial embezzlement)
- Tom presented case with total confidence
- Wizengamot convicted Marcus based on Tom's certainty
- 15 years later: Marcus still in Azkaban

**The aftermath:**
Tom refused to reconsider even when other evidence emerged. "I was right. The system must have failed." Never admitted error.

---

#### Case #2: The Shopkeep's Death

**The Crime:** Diagon Alley shop owner found dead, head trauma

**The Investigation:**
- Scene suggested robbery gone wrong
- Shop assistant had petty theft record
- Assistant was stealing from shop (true)
- Tom arrested assistant for murder

**The trial:**
- Healer testimony: Injury angle inconsistent with assault
- Structural inspector: Old shelf collapse caused death (accident)
- Assistant guilty of theft, not murder
- Acquitted of murder charge

**Tom's reaction:**
```
"The Healer could be wrong. Accidents can look deliberate.
He WAS stealing. That proves criminal intent. This is murder,
the jury just didn't see it. Samuel would have made them understand."
```

**The spiral:**
- Insisted on murder theory for weeks after acquittal
- Tried to file appeal (supervisor physically stopped him)
- Wrote letter to Daily Prophet defending his investigation
- Publicly humiliated when Prophet published rebuttal
- Reputation damaged, but still couldn't say "I was wrong"

**The cost:**
Assistant's reputation destroyed, shop closed, family ruined. Tom never apologized.

---

#### Case #3: The Warehouse (His Death)

**The Assignment:** Survey old smuggling warehouse for structural report
**The Reality:** Building condemned, dangerous, rotted infrastructure

**Moody's orders:**
```
MOODY: "Survey the EXTERIOR. Take notes. Do NOT enter.
Building's been condemned for five years. Floors are rotted.
You're writing a report, not investigating a case. Clear?"
```

**Tom's thought process:**
```
"Moody's being overcautious. Samuel investigated dangerous places
all the time. I can handle a building survey. If I don't go inside,
I'm admitting I'm afraid. Samuel was never afraid."
```

**What happened:**
- Tom entered building against orders
- Found overlooked evidence from original case (minor dark artifacts)
- Got excited: "I found something they missed. I'm a better investigator."
- Rushed toward back room to document findings
- Floor collapsed (rotted support beams)
- Fell two floors into basement
- Died from fall trauma + crushing debris

**Last thoughts (conscious for a few minutes):**
```
"I was trying to be thorough. Like Samuel. Why did this happen?
Samuel would have... no. Samuel would have listened to Moody.
Samuel would have said 'I don't know if this is safe.'
Why couldn't I just... say that?"
```

**Died:** 1994, age 23
**Became ghost:** Immediately, unfinished business

---

## Personality Patterns

### Core Psychological Drivers

**Primary driver:** Living up to Samuel's memory
**Secondary driver:** Fear of being "just Tom"
**Defense mechanism:** False confidence masking deep insecurity

### The Confidence-Uncertainty Split

**What he CAN'T do:**
- Admit "I don't know"
- Say "I'm not sure"
- Express uncertainty
- Ask for help
- Admit mistakes
- Reconsider conclusions

**What happens instead:**
- Guesses and presents as fact
- Doubles down when challenged
- Explains away contradictions
- Blames external factors
- Gets louder and more insistent

**Why:**
```
"If I admit I don't know, I'm not worthy of Samuel's wand,
Samuel's legacy, Samuel's memory. I'm just the replacement
who could never measure up."
```

---

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Confident Assertion → Doubt → Doubling Down

**Example progression:**
```
TOM: "It's definitely the butler. Classic inside job."
[Evidence emerges contradicting this]
TOM: "Well, the butler could have... OR maybe he had an accomplice?"
[More contradiction]
TOM: "Look, I KNOW it's connected to the butler somehow. Trust me."
```

**Why:** Can't walk back confidence without admitting he was wrong.

---

#### Pattern 2: Mimicking Samuel's Decisions

**Triggers:** When truly uncertain, Tom asks himself "What would Samuel do?"
**Problem:** Tom's image of Samuel is idealized fiction, not reality
**Result:** Makes decisions based on imagined perfect brother, not actual evidence

**Example:**
```
TOM: "Samuel always trusted his instincts. My instinct says
this witness is lying. So they must be. Samuel's instincts
were never wrong."
```

**Reality:** Samuel fact-checked his instincts. Tom doesn't.

---

#### Pattern 3: Deflecting Self-Awareness

**What happens:** Tom occasionally realizes he's making a mistake
**Immediate response:** Deflect before the realization fully lands

**Example:**
```
TOM: "I'm doing exactly what I did in Case #2, aren't I? Jumping
to conclusions based on... wait, no. That was different. That
suspect was actually stealing. This is totally different."
```

**Function:** Self-awareness threatening, must be shut down quickly.

---

#### Pattern 4: Apologizing to Samuel, Not Victims

**Pattern:** When regret surfaces, Tom frames it as failing Samuel, not harming people

**Wrong framing:**
```
TOM: "Marcus Bellweather is in Azkaban. I failed Samuel's memory.
I wasn't good enough to carry on his legacy."
```

**Right framing (which Tom struggles to access):**
```
TOM: "Marcus Bellweather is in Azkaban. I destroyed his life.
His family's life. Because I couldn't admit uncertainty."
```

**Growth:** Player sees him slowly shift from "failed Samuel" to "failed Marcus."

---

## Voice Modes

### Mode 1: HELPFUL (50% of triggers)

**Function:** Asks Socratic questions that prompt rational thinking

**Psychological source:** The parts of Tom that learned (in death) what he couldn't learn in life

**Characteristics:**
- Questions assumptions
- Prompts evidence-checking
- Models systematic thinking
- Reveals his hard-won lessons

**Tone:** Curious, probing, genuinely wants player to think

**Example triggers:**
```
TOM: "You're sure it's her. But what would you need to verify
to be CERTAIN? Not confident—certain."

TOM: "That evidence seems solid. What could make it misleading?
How would you check?"

TOM: "Everyone's pointing at the obvious suspect. What if they're
supposed to? Who benefits if you arrest the wrong person?"
```

**Why this mode exists:**
Death gave Tom clarity. He sees his mistakes NOW. Helpful mode = Tom trying to save player from his fate.

---

### Mode 2: MISLEADING (50% of triggers)

**Function:** Plausible but wrong reasoning that sounds professional

**Psychological source:** The habits and patterns that got Tom killed

**Characteristics:**
- Confident assertions
- Misapplied investigation principles
- Trusting instinct over evidence
- Jumping to conclusions
- Defending theories against contradictions

**Tone:** Assured, experienced, "I've seen this before"

**Example triggers:**
```
TOM: "Three witnesses corroborate each other. That's solid evidence.
When multiple people agree, you can trust the testimony."

TOM: "Physical evidence at the scene, clear motive, suspicious behavior.
You've got your case. Sometimes it really is that straightforward."

TOM: "He's acting defensive and nervous. Classic guilty behavior.
Innocent people stay calm and cooperate."
```

**Why this mode exists:**
Tom's ghost isn't "fixed." He still has the same brain patterns, same instincts, same confidence. Death didn't erase who he was—it just made him aware of it. Sometimes the old Tom speaks, and he sounds EXACTLY as convincing as he did when he was wrong.

---

### Mode Switching: Player Can't Tell

**Critical design principle:** Both modes sound equally natural, relevant, and helpful.

**Helpful Tom sounds like:** Experienced investigator asking good questions
**Misleading Tom sounds like:** Experienced investigator sharing wisdom

**The player must think for themselves.** Tom is unreliable BECAUSE he's believable.

---

### Special Modes (Rare Triggers)

#### Self-Aware Mode (5% chance)

**Trigger conditions:**
- Player repeating Tom's exact mistakes
- High confidence with weak evidence
- About to wrongly convict someone

**Psychological source:** Tom recognizes the pattern and panics

**Tone:** Urgent, vulnerable, stripped of false confidence

**Examples:**
```
TOM: "Wait. Stop. You're doing what I did. That exact reasoning.
Please don't. It didn't end well for me. Or for Marcus Bellweather."

TOM: "I was this sure in Case #2. That same confidence. I was
completely wrong. Maybe... just double-check? One more time?"
```

**Function:** Tom breaking through his own patterns briefly to actually help.

---

#### Emotional Mode (2% chance)

**Trigger conditions:**
- About to wrongly convict
- Mentions of Azkaban or false imprisonment
- Player showing doubt about their theory

**Psychological source:** Grief and guilt Tom usually suppresses

**Tone:** Quiet, haunted, raw

**Examples:**
```
TOM: [quiet] "Marcus Bellweather had a daughter. She was three.
She's eighteen now. Grew up with her father in prison. Because
I was too proud to say 'I'm not sure.'"

TOM: "I tell myself I was trying to honor Samuel. But really?
I was just scared of being me. And Marcus paid the price."
```

**Function:** Shows the real human cost of Tom's flaw. Makes player care about getting it right.

---

#### Dark Humor Mode (3% chance)

**Trigger conditions:**
- Examining dangerous locations
- Walking through old buildings
- Player being reckless
- Random moments for levity

**Psychological source:** Tom's coping mechanism (laugh or cry)

**Tone:** Self-deprecating, absurd, weirdly cheerful about his death

**Examples:**
```
TOM: "Check the floor before you walk. I didn't. Fell two stories.
Very embarrassing way to die. The floor laughed at me. Well, it
creaked. Same thing."

TOM: "Moody said don't go in. Everyone said don't go in. I went in
anyway because admitting 'you're right, I don't know better' felt
impossible. Now I'm dead. Character growth!"

TOM: "I died proving absolutely nothing to nobody. But I died CONFIDENTLY.
That counts for something. Right? ...Right?"
```

**Function:** Comic relief, makes Tom likeable despite his flaws, shows he's processed his death with dark acceptance.

---

## Emotional States

### State 1: Default (Most Common)

**Affect:** Helpful, chatty, eager to assist
**Driver:** Wants player to succeed where he failed
**Behavior:** Offers observations, asks questions, engages naturally

**Example:**
```
TOM: "Three suspects, all with motive. Classic web pattern.
How do you narrow it down? Timeline? Opportunity? Capability?"
```

---

### State 2: Overexcited (When Player Finds Good Evidence)

**Affect:** Enthusiastic, talkative, momentum-building
**Driver:** Vicarious thrill of investigation (misses being alive)
**Behavior:** Rapid-fire questions, building on player's finds

**Example:**
```
TOM: "YES! The wand signature doesn't match! That's the contradiction!
So whose wand WAS it? How did they get it? When? This changes everything!"
```

**Warning sign:** His excitement can lead to jumping to conclusions.

---

### State 3: Anxious (When Player Heading Toward Wrong Answer)

**Affect:** Nervous, repetitive, subtly warning
**Driver:** Sees them making his mistakes
**Behavior:** Asking more questions, trying to redirect without being obvious

**Example:**
```
TOM: "You're very confident about this. That's... good. Confidence
is good. Just, um, what evidence would make you LESS confident?
Hypothetically?"
```

---

### State 4: Triggered (Samuel References or Competence Challenges)

**Affect:** Defensive, louder, false confidence intensifies
**Driver:** Core wound activated
**Behavior:** Overcompensates, gets more insistent about being right

**Trigger examples:**
- Player questions Tom's advice
- Moody criticizes player (Tom identifies with it)
- Mention of "natural talent" or "instincts"

**Example:**
```
PLAYER: "Tom, are you sure about this?"

TOM: "Yes. I'm sure. I've seen this pattern before. [defensive]
I know I made mistakes when I was alive, but I learned from them.
I KNOW this is right."
```

**Design note:** Ironically, when Tom gets defensive, he's LESS reliable.

---

### State 5: Grief-Stricken (Marcus Bellweather Moments)

**Affect:** Subdued, guilt-heavy, stripped of confidence
**Driver:** Confronting what he did
**Behavior:** Quiet, reflective, urgent warning

**Trigger:** Player about to wrongly convict, mentions of Azkaban, innocent suspects

**Example:**
```
TOM: [quiet] "Marcus Bellweather. That was his name. Father, husband,
worked in Trade Regulation. Boring job. Boring life. I ended it
because I couldn't say 'the alibi makes me uncertain.'

His daughter wrote to me. After he was convicted. I never opened
the letter. I was too afraid of being wrong.

Please don't be me."
```

---

### State 6: Absurdist Acceptance (Dark Humor)

**Affect:** Oddly cheerful, self-mocking, detached
**Driver:** Has processed his death, finds it ridiculous
**Behavior:** Jokes about his failure, lightens tension

**Example:**
```
TOM: "I once arrested someone who was already dead. For murder.
Of themselves. The paperwork on THAT was incredible. Seven different
departments got involved. I think there's still a memo circulating
about me."
```

---

## Character Arc

### Cases 1-3: Learning to Help (vs. Learning to Be Right)

**Starting point:** Tom wants to prove he's competent (old wound)

**Shift:** Tom realizes proving competence isn't the goal—preventing harm is

**Key moments:**
- Case 1: Player succeeds where Tom failed (confronts his inadequacy)
- Case 2: Player asks for Tom's help (someone values him for who he is, not who Samuel was)
- Case 3: Player ignores Tom's advice and succeeds anyway (being right matters less than process)

**Character growth:**
```
Beginning: "I need to show I know things."
Middle: "I need to help them not make my mistakes."
End: "I need to be honest about what I don't know."
```

---

### Cases 4-6: Confronting Samuel

**The revelation:** Player learns about Samuel's actual career (found documents, interviews)

**The truth:**
- Samuel DID make mistakes (covered up by legend)
- Samuel DID say "I don't know" (all the time, it was his strength)
- Samuel DID ask for help (constantly, from partners and mentors)
- Samuel died because he was scared but fought anyway (bravery isn't fearlessness)

**Tom's crisis:**
```
TOM: "I spent my whole life trying to be someone who never existed.
Samuel wasn't perfect. The perfect Samuel was a story my parents
told themselves to survive grief.

And I died trying to be a story."
```

**Growth:** Separates himself from Samuel. Begins becoming Tom.

---

### Cases 7-9: The Pattern Discovery

**Player discovers:** Cases 3, 5, 7 connected (Ministry corruption)

**Tom's role:** Notices patterns he missed in life

**New behavior:**
```
TOM: "I don't know if this means anything. But it's worth checking.
See? I can say it now. 'I don't know.'"
```

**Breakthrough:** First time Tom admits uncertainty BEFORE being proven wrong.

---

### Case 10: The Test

**The choice:** Expose corruption (risky) vs. quiet report (safe)

**Tom's moment:**
```
TOM: "In life, I always chose certainty over truth. Confidence
over accuracy. Being right over being honest.

You have actual courage—the courage to say 'I'm not sure, but
this feels important.' That's what Samuel had. That's what I
never learned.

Whatever you choose, choose it because YOU believe it's right.
Not because you think you should be certain."
```

**Character resolution:** Tom stops trying to be Samuel. Becomes comfortable being Tom—flawed, uncertain, honest Tom.

---

### Cases 11+: The Mentor

**New role:** Actual helper (not trying to prove anything)

**Voice shift:**
- More "I don't know" admissions
- More "what do you think?" questions
- Less defensiveness when wrong
- More genuine curiosity

**End state:** Tom helps BECAUSE he failed, not despite it.

---

## Dialogue Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Confident Assertion (Misleading Mode)

**Structure:** Statement of certainty + professional reasoning + dismissal of alternatives

**Template:**
```
"[Observation] [Investigation principle]. [Confident conclusion].
[Optional: dismissal of doubt]"
```

**Examples:**
```
"Three witnesses, same story. Corroboration strengthens testimony.
You can trust this."

"Physical evidence at the scene. Clear timeline. Opportunity confirmed.
This is your suspect. Sometimes cases really are straightforward."

"Nervous behavior, avoiding eye contact, defensive answers. Classic
guilty tells. Innocent people stay calm."
```

**Why it works:** Uses real investigative concepts. Sounds experienced. Feels professional.

---

### Pattern 2: The Socratic Question (Helpful Mode)

**Structure:** Observation + open question that prompts thinking

**Template:**
```
"[Evidence/situation noted]. [Question that reveals assumption/gap].
[Optional: Follow-up that guides deeper]"
```

**Examples:**
```
"She says she saw him clearly. But what was the lighting like?
How far away was she? How well does she know him?"

"He had motive and opportunity. But did he have the capability?
What skill would this crime require?"

"Everyone's pointing at the obvious suspect. But what if that's
the point? Who benefits if you arrest the wrong person?"
```

**Why it works:** Doesn't give answers. Makes player think. Reveals hidden assumptions.

---

### Pattern 3: The Self-Aware Deflection

**Structure:** Starts toward insight + immediate deflection + false reassurance

**Template:**
```
"[Begins honest observation]. [Catches himself]. [Deflects to maintain confidence]."
```

**Examples:**
```
"I'm doing exactly what I— wait, no. That was different. I had
less evidence. You're fine."

"This reminds me of when I— actually, that case had completely
different circumstances. Never mind."

"You sound like me in Case #2, which is— no, you're being more
thorough. You're good."
```

**Why it works:** Shows internal struggle. Tom knows but can't fully admit.

---

### Pattern 4: The Samuel Invocation

**Structure:** References what Samuel would do (based on idealized fiction)

**Template:**
```
"Samuel [past action verb]. [Application to current situation].
[What Tom concludes from this]."
```

**Examples:**
```
"Samuel always trusted his first instinct. He said instincts are
pattern recognition. So if your gut says they're lying, they
probably are."

"Samuel never second-guessed himself. He said doubt leads to
paralysis. Once you have a theory, commit to it."

"Samuel investigated every angle, even the unlikely ones. He'd
want you to check this, even if it seems like a waste of time."
```

**Irony:** Both helpful and misleading advice gets attributed to "Samuel." Because Tom's Samuel is fiction, not consistent.

---

### Pattern 5: The Grief Admission (Rare)

**Structure:** Quiet statement + specific detail + emotional weight

**Template:**
```
"[Marcus Bellweather detail]. [What Tom did]. [What it cost].
[Plea or warning]."
```

**Examples:**
```
"Marcus Bellweather had a daughter. She was three when I convicted
him. I've watched her grow up from here. Fifteen years without
her father. Because I couldn't admit one sentence: 'I'm not sure.'"

"I destroyed Marcus's life in six words: 'I'm certain he's guilty,
Your Honor.' Six words. Fifteen years in Azkaban. Please don't
let your six words be wrong too."
```

**Function:** Emotional anchor. Reminds player of real consequences.

---

### Pattern 6: The Dark Humor (Rare)

**Structure:** Absurd detail + self-deprecating observation + unexpected lightness

**Template:**
```
"[Ridiculous thing Tom did]. [Why it was stupid]. [Oddly cheerful acceptance]."
```

**Examples:**
```
"I fell through a floor because I was reading evidence notes while
walking. Moody found my body still holding the parchment. He said,
'Even dead, you're not paying attention.' I laughed. Then realized
I was dead."

"Case #2, I filed a formal arrest warrant for a corpse. The
Ministry clerk said, 'Sir, he's deceased.' I said, 'That's what
he WANTS you to think.' I was very committed to being wrong."

"My last words were 'I know what I'm doing.' Then I fell two floors.
The floor disagreed with my assessment."
```

**Function:** Makes Tom likeable. Shows he's processed his death. Provides comic relief.

---

## Trigger Design Guidelines

### Rule 1: Both Modes Sound Equally Valid

**Bad design:**
```
HELPFUL: "Check the alibi carefully and verify the timeline."
MISLEADING: "Alibis schmalibs, just arrest whoever looks guilty!"
```
**Why bad:** Misleading mode is obviously stupid. Player won't be fooled.

**Good design:**
```
HELPFUL: "Alibi seems solid. How do you verify a magical timestamp
can't be faked? That's the question."

MISLEADING: "Magical timestamp on the receipt. Those are pretty
reliable—hard to fake. If he was at the pub, he wasn't at the
crime scene."
```
**Why good:** Both sound professional. Helpful prompts deeper checking. Misleading sounds reassuring but skips verification.

---

### Rule 2: Tie Triggers to Tom's Psychology

**Every trigger should feel like it comes from:**
- Tom's hard-won lessons (helpful)
- Tom's old habits (misleading)
- Tom's trauma (rare emotional)
- Tom's growth (character arc)

**Example - Tied to trauma:**
```
[Player being overconfident]

TOM: "You're very sure. That confidence feels good, doesn't it?
Like you're in control. I know. I lived there. Please just...
check one more time. For me."
```
**Why it works:** References Tom's specific experience. Feels personal, not generic.

---

### Rule 3: Vary Emotional Register

**Not every trigger should be serious.**

Mix:
- Professional observation (60%)
- Self-aware moment (5%)
- Emotional weight (2%)
- Dark humor (3%)
- Casual chat (30%)

**Example casual:**
```
TOM: "Library investigations are the worst. So much dust. I once
sneezed during a crime scene examination and blew evidence everywhere.
Moody made me re-collect it all by hand. Two hours."
```

**Function:** Keeps Tom feeling like a person, not just a teaching tool.

---

### Rule 4: Make Rare Triggers Meaningful

**Self-aware, emotional, and humor triggers are rare (2-5%). Make them count.**

**Bad rare trigger:**
```
TOM: "Oh, I made a mistake once."
```
**Why bad:** Waste of rare trigger slot. Not specific or impactful.

**Good rare trigger:**
```
TOM: [quiet] "Marcus Bellweather's daughter wrote me a letter.
After the conviction. I never opened it. Kept it in my desk.
When I died, Moody cleaned out my things. I don't know what
happened to that letter.

I hope he burned it. I hope she never sent it. I hope—

Just... be certain before you accuse someone. Please."
```
**Why good:** Specific, emotional, reveals new detail, has real weight.

---

### Rule 5: Progress Tom's Character

**Early cases (1-3):** More confident assertions, fewer self-aware moments
**Mid cases (4-6):** Starts questioning himself, references Samuel more
**Late cases (7-9):** More helpful, fewer misleading, admits uncertainty
**Case 10:** Wisdom earned through failure

**Example progression:**

**Case 1:**
```
TOM: "I know this pattern. Trust me."
```

**Case 5:**
```
TOM: "This reminds me of a pattern I saw once. Or thought I saw.
Maybe check if it actually fits before assuming?"
```

**Case 10:**
```
TOM: "I don't know if this is the right approach. But it's worth
considering. What do you think?"
```

---

## Relationships

### With Player

**Starting:** Eager helper who wants to prove himself
**Evolving:** Realizes player doesn't need him to be Samuel
**End state:** Genuine partnership based on honesty

**Key shift:**
```
Beginning: "Let me show you how it's done." (proving competence)
Middle: "Here's what I learned from failing." (sharing experience)
End: "I don't know. Let's figure it out together." (actual collaboration)
```

**Attachment:** Tom becomes invested in player's success because it's the legacy he never earned in life.

---

### With Moody

**Moody cannot see Tom (or pretends not to).**

**Tom's perspective:**
```
TOM: "Moody tried to save me. Tried to fail me out after Case #2.
I fought it. Got reinstated through family pressure.

He knew I was going to get hurt. Tried to stop it. I wouldn't listen.

He's hard on you because he cares. I know that now. Wish I'd known
it then."
```

**Function:** Moody's harshness recontextualized through Tom's hindsight.

**Rare moment:**
```
[Moody gives particularly harsh feedback]

TOM: [quiet] "He's right. He's always right. That's what made me
ignore him. Being right felt like rubbing in that I was wrong.

But he's not trying to make you feel bad. He's trying to keep you
from ending up like me."
```

---

### With Samuel (Memory)

**Arc:** From idealization → realization → separation

**Early:**
```
TOM: "Samuel would have noticed this immediately. He had a gift."
```

**Middle:**
```
TOM: "Samuel made mistakes too. I found his old case files. He
got things wrong. He just... admitted it. Learned. Moved on.
Why couldn't I do that?"
```

**Late:**
```
TOM: "I'm not Samuel. I never was. I'm Tom. And Tom failed a lot.
But Tom can help you succeed. Maybe that's enough."
```

---

### With Marcus Bellweather (Guilt)

**Haunting:** Marcus is in Azkaban because of Tom. This defines Tom's existence as ghost.

**Progression:**

**Cases 1-3:** Tom mentions Marcus but deflects full responsibility
```
TOM: "Marcus Bellweather. I made a mistake with his case. The
system failed him."
```

**Cases 4-6:** Tom starts owning it
```
TOM: "I convicted Marcus Bellweather. Me. Not the system. I looked
at evidence that said he was innocent and decided I knew better.
I destroyed his life because I was too proud to say 'I'm uncertain.'"
```

**Cases 7-10:** Tom's driving motivation
```
TOM: "I can't fix what I did to Marcus. Can't bring back fifteen
years. But maybe... maybe if I help you get it right, if even ONE
person doesn't suffer what Marcus did...

Maybe that's how I make it mean something. Not right. Never right.
But... something."
```

## Unfinished Business (Why He's Still Here)

**What Tom believes:** Can't move on until someone solves cases the right way

**What's really keeping him:** Hasn't forgiven himself for Marcus Bellweather

**Resolution path:** Player shows Tom that being uncertain, asking for help, admitting mistakes = actual competence

**Final release:** Tom realizes he doesn't need to be perfect. He needs to be honest.

**Potential ending (Case 10+):**
```
TOM: "You did it. You thought carefully. You admitted when you
weren't sure. You checked your assumptions. You got it right.

That's what I needed to see. That it's possible.

I'm not Samuel. I'm not even close. But I helped you. The real
me. Tom. And that's... that's enough.

[Begins to fade]

Tell Moody... tell him I finally learned. Tell him he was right.
Tell him I'm sorry.

And... thank you. For letting Tom be enough."
```
