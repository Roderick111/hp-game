# Story Design Process: 5-Layer Method

**Philosophy:** Build complexity through iterative layers, not all at once. Each pass adds specific elements and checks specific coherence.

**Use for:** Detective stories, mystery games, thriller novels, investigation-based narratives

**Total Time:** 4-6 hours for complete case

---

## Overview: The 5 Layers

```
LAYER 1: SKELETON (30-60 min)
→ Write true story, establish causality, check universe coherence

LAYER 2: WEB (45-90 min)
→ Map relationships, ensure 3+ connections per character, check canon realism

LAYER 3: EVIDENCE (60-90 min)
→ Create physical traces, design ambiguous evidence, map to theories

LAYER 4: LOCATIONS (45-60 min)
→ Spatial logic, physical coherence, location storytelling

LAYER 5: COMPLEXITY (60-90 min)
→ Add contradictions, design secret webs, multi-theory validation

LAYER 6: POLISH (30 min - optional)
→ Final coherence check
```

**Key Principle:** Each layer builds on the previous, adding specific complexity without overwhelming. You can return to earlier layers to revise when later layers reveal gaps.

---

## LAYER 1: Core Architecture (The Skeleton)

**Purpose:** Establish the fundamental causal chain and universe coherence

**Time:** 30-60 minutes

### What You Do:

1. **Write the True Story (500 words max)**
   - What actually happened, in chronological order
   - Who did what, when, where, why
   - No ambiguity, just facts

2. **Answer the Core Questions:**
   - What crime occurred?
   - Who is the culprit?
   - What was their motive?
   - What was their method?
   - What was the opportunity/timing?

3. **Universe Coherence Check:**
   - Could this happen in [your universe] canon?
   - Does the magic/technology make sense?
   - Are character actions consistent with universe logic?
   - Would authority figures realistically handle it this way?

### Example (HP Universe - Case 002):

```
TRUE STORY:
Helena Blackwood (4th year Ravenclaw) discovered Professor Vector's
1991 Arithmancy theorem was fraudulent. She found the original
manuscript in the archives showing Vector fabricated a key variable.

Helena approached Vector at 10 PM in the Restricted Section, offering
to help fix the fraud privately. Vector panicked, realizing her
15-year career was at stake. She used Wingardium Leviosa to topple
a bookshelf onto Helena, staging it as an accident.

Vector then blackmailed Argus Filch (who found the body) into
cleaning the scene by threatening to expose his Kwikspell letters.
```

**Universe Check:**
- ✅ Professors can commit crimes (Lockhart, Quirrell, Crouch Jr.)
- ✅ Academic fraud is realistic (scholars value legacy)
- ✅ Hogwarts has poor security (canon fact)
- ✅ Filch is vulnerable to blackmail (canon characterization)
- ✅ Arithmancy exists but is underexplored (safe territory)

### Output:
One-page document with true story + universe checks

---

## LAYER 2: Character Web (The Connections)

**Purpose:** Map relationships and create interdependencies

**Time:** 45-90 minutes

### What You Do:

1. **List All Characters:**
   - Victim
   - Culprit
   - 2-4 suspects/witnesses
   - 0-2 background characters

2. **Create Relationship Matrix:**
   - For each pair, ask: "What connects them?"
   - **Minimum rule:** Each character must connect to 3+ others
   - Types of connections:
     - Professional (teacher/student, colleagues)
     - Personal (friendship, rivalry, family)
     - Transactional (blackmail, favor, debt)
     - Historical (past event, shared secret)

3. **Find Causal Connections:**
   - Which relationships are ESSENTIAL to the crime?
   - Which relationships CREATE the opportunity?
   - Which relationships provide MOTIVE?
   - Which relationships create EVIDENCE?

4. **Canon Realism Check:**
   - Would these people naturally interact?
   - Are connections appropriate for their roles?
   - Do connections respect universe social structures?

### Example (Case 002 - Revised):

```
CHARACTER WEB:

Helena ←→ Vector: Mentor/protégé (3 years), weekly meetings
Helena ←→ Adrian: Housemates, study partners investigating fraud
Helena ←→ Filch: Transactional (she didn't report his Kwikspell,
                    he gave her Restricted Section access)
Helena ←→ Marcus: Transactional (paid him to create distraction)

Vector ←→ Filch: Blackmail (Kwikspell letters)
Vector ←→ Adrian: Distant (just another student)
Vector ←→ Marcus: None (different house, no classes)

Adrian ←→ Filch: None (or: Filch caught Adrian helping Helena)
Adrian ←→ Marcus: None (different houses, different years)

Marcus ←→ Filch: Historical (Filch caught him before for rule-breaking)

CANON CHECK:
✅ Ravenclaw students studying together (natural)
✅ Professor mentoring promising student (common)
✅ Filch's Kwikspell is canon (Chamber of Secrets)
✅ Students paying other students for favors (realistic)
✅ Slytherin/Ravenclaw don't naturally interact (explains Marcus isolation)
```

### Output:
Relationship matrix with 3+ connections per character

---

## LAYER 3: Evidence Design (Physical Manifestation)

**Purpose:** Transform relationships and events into discoverable evidence

**Time:** 60-90 minutes

### What You Do:

1. **For Each Major Event/Relationship, Ask:**
   - "What physical trace would this leave?"
   - "What would witnesses see/hear?"
   - "What objects would be involved?"

2. **Create Two Types of Evidence:**

   **Type A: Eliminating Evidence** (3-4 pieces)
   - Clearly rules out suspects
   - Establishes timeline
   - Proves/disproves theories
   - Example: Helena's wand showing Lumos (eliminates accident)

   **Type B: Ambiguous Evidence** (4-6 pieces)
   - Supports 2-3 different interpretations
   - Connects to multiple character stories
   - Requires other evidence to clarify
   - Example: Silver locket in alcove (Marcus/Helena relationship—but what kind?)

3. **Map Evidence to Theories:**
   - Evidence 1 → Theory A (40% support), Theory B (30%), Theory C (20%)
   - Ensure multiple theories are viable until key evidence found
   - No evidence should have 100% single interpretation until endgame

4. **Canon Realism Check:**
   - Would this object exist in your universe?
   - Is the magical/technological trace consistent with universe rules?
   - Are evidence scales realistic? (Don't use overly elaborate items)
   - Would these characters actually have these items?

### Example (Case 002 - Evidence Mapping):

```
EVENT: Helena paid Marcus for distraction
EVIDENCE OPTIONS:
❌ Coins with Helena's signature (too elaborate, unrealistic)
❌ Signed contract (too formal for students)
✅ Marcus has expensive new quidditch gloves + Helena's last
   withdrawal slip from Gringotts (50 Galleons, same day)
✅ Note in Marcus's pocket: "10 PM, alcove. Make noise. —H"

INTERPRETATIONS:
A) Helena paid Marcus to create distraction (truth)
B) Helena was bribing Marcus to keep quiet about something
C) Helena and Marcus were planning something together
D) Marcus stole the money and killed Helena (false theory)

---

EVENT: Vector erased library log
EVIDENCE: Erased log entry showing "S. Vector, 10:15 PM"

AMBIGUITY ADDED:
✅ Actually THREE erased names: S. Vector, M. Flint, [damaged]

INTERPRETATIONS:
A) Vector erased all three to hide murder timeline (truth)
B) Vector protecting Marcus (false)
C) Someone else erased all three to frame Vector (false)
D) Third name is real killer (false)
```

**Canon Check:**
- ✅ Library checkout logs exist (mentioned in canon)
- ✅ Gringotts withdrawal slips realistic
- ✅ Students pass notes (very common in HP)
- ✅ Specialis Revelio can reveal erasures (plausible magical forensics)

### Output:
7-10 evidence pieces, half ambiguous, mapped to theories

---

## LAYER 4: Location as Storyteller (Spatial Logic)

**Purpose:** Ensure locations reveal character stories and follow physical logic

**Time:** 45-60 minutes

### What You Do:

1. **For Each Location, Answer:**
   - Why did events happen HERE specifically?
   - What does this location say about the character who uses it?
   - What evidence naturally exists here vs. planted?
   - Who has ACCESS to this location and why?

2. **Add Location Details That Tell Stories:**
   - Wear patterns (who uses this space regularly?)
   - Hidden spaces (who knows about them?)
   - Personal items (who feels comfortable/unsafe here?)
   - Sight lines (who can see/hear from where?)

3. **Physical Logic Check:**
   - Can Character A see Character B from Location X?
   - How long to travel between locations?
   - What sound carries through walls?
   - Where would evidence naturally fall/be left?

4. **Canon Architecture Check:**
   - Is this location consistent with universe layout?
   - Do spatial relationships make sense?
   - Are security measures realistic?

### Example (Case 002):

```
LOCATION: Study Alcove (behind tapestry)

WHY HERE:
- Hidden from main library (privacy for illicit activities)
- Shares wall with Restricted Section (sound carries)
- Close enough to hear crash, far enough to avoid danger
- Marcus knows about it (older student, uses for dueling practice)

WHAT IT REVEALS:
- Warm chair → Recently occupied
- Clove smell → Hand of Glory residue (dark artifact)
- Clear sight line to library entrance → Lookout position
- Hidden passage behind bookshelf → How Marcus escapes undetected

EVIDENCE PLACEMENT LOGIC:
✅ Marcus's scarf draped on chair (he was comfortable, not rushed)
✅ Scorch marks on wall from duel practice (habitual use)
✅ Two empty Butterbeer bottles (he waited here before)
❌ Helena's research notes (why would they be HERE? She used Restricted Section)

CANON CHECK:
✅ Hidden alcoves exist (Room of Requirement precedent)
✅ Tapestries hide passages (Fat Lady portrait, Ariana painting)
✅ Students find secret spots (Marauders, DA)
✅ Adjacent rooms share walls (sound carries - canon in CoS)

---

LOCATION: Restricted Section Crime Scene

WHY HERE:
- Helena needed original manuscript (only stored here)
- Vector suggested meeting here (control, privacy, no witnesses)
- Bookshelf positioned for "accident" staging (premeditation)

WHAT IT REVEALS:
- Scuff marks on floor → Shelf moved into position (premeditation)
- Helena's bag near manuscript shelves → She was researching, not fleeing
- No defensive spell traces except Lumos → She trusted Vector until last moment
- Ceiling scorch marks → High-power magic (eliminates students)

PHYSICAL LOGIC:
- Bookshelf 8 feet tall, 300+ lbs → Requires strong Leviosa
- Helena 10 feet away → Had to be moved, then dropped
- Blood spatter pattern → Fell from above, not pushed
- Dust patterns → Only ONE set of adult footprints approaching shelf (Vector's)

CANON CHECK:
✅ Restricted Section poorly supervised (canon - Harry breaks in multiple times)
✅ Ancient books are heavy and dangerous (Monster Book of Monsters precedent)
✅ Levitation can move furniture (Wingardium Leviosa lessons)
```

### Output:
3-5 locations with spatial logic, evidence placement rationale, canon checks

---

## LAYER 5: Contradiction & Depth Pass (Complexity Layer)

**Purpose:** Add final complexity through contradictions, secrets, and multi-interpretation evidence

**Time:** 60-90 minutes

### What You Do:

1. **Add Witness Contradictions:**
   - Identify 2-3 key facts
   - Have different witnesses remember/report differently
   - Ensure both could be true OR one is lying OR both are mistaken
   - **Rule:** Contradiction must be resolvable through investigation

2. **Design Tiered Secrets:**

   **Tier 1 Secrets** (Trust 30-50%): Minor embarrassments, rule-breaking
   - Example: "I was out of bed after curfew"

   **Tier 2 Secrets** (Trust 60-75%): Moral compromises, involvement
   - Example: "I helped Helena break into the office"

   **Tier 3 Secrets** (Trust 80%+): Incriminating knowledge, complicity
   - Example: "I heard Vector threaten Helena"

   **Rule:** Each secret must connect to ANOTHER character's story

3. **Multi-Theory Test:**
   - List 3-4 plausible theories
   - Ensure each theory is supported by 40%+ of evidence
   - Identify "turning point" evidence that shifts theories
   - Make sure only ONE theory fits ALL evidence

4. **Character Depth Check:**
   - Does each character have wants, fears, moral complexity?
   - Do characters make REALISTIC mistakes? (not stupid, not perfect)
   - Are motivations clear but not simplistic?

5. **Canon Behavior Check:**
   - Would authority figures realistically act this way?
   - Do characters act consistent with universe norms?

### Example (Case 002 - Contradictions):

```
CONTRADICTION 1: Time of Discovery

Adrian: "I heard the crash at 10:05 and ran immediately"
Filch: "I found the body at 10:05"
Vector: "I arrived at 10:10 after Filch summoned me"

RESOLUTION:
- Adrian heard crash, fled, didn't investigate (cowardice)
- Filch found body at 10:05 (true)
- Vector ALREADY THERE, hiding, emerged when Filch arrived (lie)
- Timeline evidence proves Vector was there BEFORE crash

---

CONTRADICTION 2: Helena's Intent

Adrian's secret: "Helena wanted to protect Vector, fix fraud quietly"
Marcus's testimony: "Helena paid me 50 Galleons to 'make noise' at 10 PM"
Filch's observation: "Helena looked determined, not scared"

INTERPRETATIONS:
A) Helena planned confrontation but wanted escape plan (distraction)
B) Helena planned to expose Vector publicly (distraction for escape)
C) Helena planned to trap Vector somehow (distraction as part of plan)

RESOLUTION:
Helena's journal (if found): "Tonight I offer her a choice. If she
refuses, M has instructions to deliver the package to Dumbledore at
10:30. Insurance, not threat."

---

SECRET WEB:

Adrian (Trust 40%): "I was in the library studying late"
Adrian (Trust 65%): "Helena and I were investigating the fraud together"
Adrian (Trust 85%): "Helena gave me copies of the manuscript three days ago.
                      They're hidden in my trunk. Vector might know."

→ Connects to Marcus: He has the third copy
→ Connects to Vector: She's looking for the copies (motive to eliminate witnesses)
→ Creates player question: Is Adrian also in danger?

Marcus (Trust 35%): "I was dueling, that's all"
Marcus (Trust 60%): "Helena paid me 50 Galleons for a distraction"
Marcus (Trust 80%): "She gave me an envelope to deliver to Dumbledore at
                     10:30 if she didn't come back. I still have it.
                     I was too scared to deliver it after she died."

→ Connects to Helena: Evidence of her planning
→ Connects to Adrian: Confirms conspiracy
→ Creates player question: What's in the envelope? Why didn't Marcus deliver it?
→ Canon check: ✅ Students freeze in crisis (very realistic - Neville, early Harry)
```

### Multi-Theory Test:

```
THEORY A: Vector murdered Helena (CORRECT)
Supported by:
- Scorch marks (high power magic) ✅
- Erased log entry ✅
- Motive (fraud exposure) ✅
- Opportunity (10 PM meeting) ✅
Contradicted by:
- [None, once all evidence found]

THEORY B: Marcus murdered Helena (false, but plausible early)
Supported by:
- Present at scene ✅
- Dark artifact residue ✅
- Had Helena's money ✅
- Erased log includes his name ✅
Contradicted by:
- Insufficient magical power (scorch marks) ❌
- No motive for murder ❌
- Timeline: he was in alcove, different room ❌

THEORY C: Accident (false, but initial assumption)
Supported by:
- Dangerous location ✅
- Helena researching alone ✅
- Books fell on her ✅
Contradicted by:
- Shelf positioning (deliberate) ❌
- Helena's last spell (Lumos, not levitation) ❌
- High-power scorch marks (external magic) ❌

THEORY D: Adrian murdered Helena (false, briefly viable)
Supported by:
- Present at scene ✅
- Fled immediately ✅
- Acting terrified (guilt?) ✅
- Had access to fraud information ✅
Contradicted by:
- Insufficient magical power ❌
- No motive (they were partners) ❌
- Genuinely didn't know copies existed ❌
```

### Canon Behavior Check:
- ✅ Authority delays investigation (gives benefit of doubt)
- ✅ Young people don't immediately report to adults (fear, loyalty)
- ✅ Trusted figures can betray that trust
- ✅ Supporting characters act according to established personality

### Output:
Contradiction matrix, secret web, multi-theory validation

---

## Why This Works

1. **Prevents Overwhelm:** You're not juggling everything at once
2. **Enforces Coherence:** Each layer has specific checks
3. **Creates Complexity Organically:** Layers interact naturally
4. **Catches Logic Gaps Early:** Each layer validates the previous
5. **Maintains Canon:** Regular universe checks throughout
6. **Generates Ambiguity:** Evidence design focused on multiple interpretations
7. **Scalable:** Same process works for simple or complex cases

---

## Quick Reference Card

```
LAYER 1: Write true story → Universe check
LAYER 2: Map relationships → 3+ per character
LAYER 3: Design evidence → 50% ambiguous
LAYER 4: Location logic → Physical coherence
LAYER 5: Add contradictions → Secret webs
LAYER 6: Final checklist → Ship it
```

**Key Insight:** Complexity emerges from interconnection, not complication. Each element should connect to 2-3 others, creating a web where pulling one thread reveals multiple stories.
