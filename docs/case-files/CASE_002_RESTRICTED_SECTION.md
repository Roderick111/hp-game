## Victim

### Helena Blackwood

```yaml
victim:
  name: "Helena Blackwood"
  age: "Fourth-year Ravenclaw"
  status: "deceased"

  humanization: |
    Fourth-year Ravenclaw. You remember her from the library—always
    buried in wandlore texts, muttering about core resonance frequencies.
    Brilliant, obsessive, the kind of student who'd sneak into the Restricted
    Section for research long after curfew. Someone silenced that curious
    mind permanently.

  connection: "classmate"
  memorable_trait: "Wandlore obsessive, talked to herself while researching"

  background:
    - "Top of her year in Charms and Transfiguration"
    - "Known for asking uncomfortable questions in Defense Against Dark Arts"
    - "Recently became interested in dark magic detection theory"
    - "Had public argument with Marcus Flint two days ago about 'Slytherin cheating'"

  time_of_death: "10:05 PM (approximately, based on evidence)"
  cause_of_death: "Blunt force trauma from bookshelf collapse (staged as accident)"
```

## Locations

### 1. Library Main Hall (Macro Hub)

  name: "Hogwarts Library - Main Hall"

  description: |
    The library's main hall stretches before you, towering shelves casting
    long shadows in the lamplight. Students' desks dot the space, most
    abandoned at this late hour. Madam Pince's desk sits empty near the
    entrance, her usual vigilance absent.

    The Restricted Section lies beyond a roped barrier to your left, its
    iron gate slightly ajar. Deeper in the main hall, study alcoves provide
    privacy for focused research.

  description: |
    Past the iron gate, the Restricted Section feels different. Colder.
    Darker books line these shelves—grimoires, forbidden texts, dangerous
    knowledge. The air itself feels heavy with old magic.

    Near the back, between shelves on Advanced Transfiguration and Dark
    Creature Defenses, you find her: Helena Blackwood, fourth-year Ravenclaw.
    She lies crumpled beneath a toppled bookshelf, ancient tomes scattered
    around her body. Her eyes stare at nothing, brilliant mind gone silent.

    You remember her from the library—always buried in wandlore texts,
    muttering about core resonance frequencies. Someone silenced that

## Suspects

### 1. Marcus Flint (RED HERRING)

  id: "marcus_flint"
  name: "Marcus Flint"
  role: "Seventh-year Slytherin, Quidditch Captain"
  age: 17
  is_guilty: false

  personality: "Aggressive, competitive, defensive about house reputation"
  wants: "Protect Slytherin house honor, win Quidditch Cup"
  fears: "Being expelled so close to graduation, father's disappointment"

  moral_complexity: |
    Marcus has a temper and makes poor choices, but he's not a killer.
    He's terrified of authority and genuinely believes following rules
    (even unfair ones) is how you survive. The confrontation with Helena
    was public and stupid, but he'd never risk Azkaban over an insult.

  means_motive_opportunity:
    means:
      has_wand: true
      knows_spells: "Wingardium Leviosa (powerful enough for heavy objects)"
      capable: true

    motive:
      apparent: "Helena publicly accused him of cheating in Potions (house points deducted)"
      actual: "Argument was serious to him, but not murder-worthy. Was being blackmailed by Helena."

    opportunity:

    knowledge:
      knows:
        - "Had argument with Helena two days ago (public, in Great Hall)"
        - "Helena accused him of using Felix Felicis in Potions class"
        - "He WAS in library earlier (7-8 PM) but left before curfew"
        - "Lost his scarf somewhere in library, couldn't find it"
      doesnt_know:
        - "Helena was researching dark magic detection"

          "Fine! YES, I used Felix Felicis in Potions. Once. ONCE. My father
          expects perfection and I was failing. Helena saw me, threatened to
          report me unless I threw the next Quidditch match.

          I went to the library that night to BEG her not to ruin my life.
          But she wasn't there when I arrived—or I couldn't find her. I left
          my scarf by accident and got out before curfew. That's ALL."

### 2. Argus Filch (RED HERRING - No Magical Means)

  wants: "Punish students who flaunt their magic, maintain order HIS way"
  fears: "Being seen as useless, losing job (his only power), wizards' contempt"

  moral_complexity: |
    Filch has spent decades watching magical children learn what he can
    never do. That kind of resentment festers. He HATES students in the
    Restricted Section after hours—it's everything he can't have, being
    flaunted. But he's not a murderer. He's a small, mean man who lives
    for petty authority. Killing would make him the monster wizards already
    think he is.

          So I left. Came back at 10:30 with Madam Pince, 'discovered' the

  wants: "Be recognized as brightest in Ravenclaw, earn Outstanding in all N.E.W.T.s, secure Ministry Honors Program placement"
  fears: "Being outshined by younger students, losing prefect status, disappointing parents"

  moral_complexity: |
    Adrian has spent six years being the smartest Ravenclaw. It defines him.
    Then Helena—two years younger—starts asking questions he can't answer,
    solving problems faster than him, making HIM look average.

    He's not evil. He's terrified. His entire identity is "the brilliant one,"
    and a fourth-year is dismantling that. But Adrian solves problems with
    studying harder, not violence. He's a teenager drowning in pressure, not
    a killer.

          I got to the library around 10 PM. Stood outside the Restricted
          Section gate, listening. I heard her talking to someone—an adult,
          sounded like. Arguing about 'collaboration' and 'credit.'

          Then I heard a crash. I panicked and ran. I should have gone in,

    Vector is brilliant and knows it. She saw Helena's potential and felt
    THREATENED. A fourth-year asking questions Vector couldn't answer?
    Intolerable. But Vector is also a professor—she has other ways to
    destroy talented students. Harsh grades, denial of recommendations,
    academic sabotage. Murder is beneath her. She fights with equations,
    not violence.

    Except... in one moment of panic, facing obsolescence at the hands of
    a child, she made a terrible choice. And now she has to live with it.

      Helena made a breakthrough in wandcore resonance theory that would
      revolutionize Arithmancy applications. Vector realized this when Helena
      asked for specific books—books Vector had consulted for her own research.

      Vector went to Restricted Section at 10:15 PM to confront Helena, demand
      to see her notes, possibly threaten her academically to slow her down.
      They argued. Helena refused to share her discovery.

      In a moment of rage and panic—seeing her life's work about to be eclipsed
      by a CHILD—Vector used Wingardium Leviosa to lift the heavy bookshelf
      and dropped it on Helena. The "accident" would be believable: student
      alone in Restricted Section, shelf collapsed, tragic but explainable.

      Vector then took Helena's wand (to prevent Prior Incantato revealing
      Helena had her wand out defensively), erased the library log entry,
      and left. The wand is hidden in Vector's office.

      eclipsed by a teenager who barely understood the foundational theory.

      I went to talk to her. To... to slow her down. Offer to collaborate—
      make it OUR discovery. She refused. Called me 'threatened' and
      'small-minded.'

      I just wanted her to WAIT. To give me time. But she wouldn't listen,

## Solution

```yaml
solution:
  culprit: "professor_vector"

  method: "Wingardium Leviosa to lift bookshelf, drop on Helena (staged as accident)"

  motive: "Academic jealousy - Helena's wandlore breakthrough would eclipse Vector's 15-year research career"

  timeline:
    - "9:47 PM: Helena enters Restricted Section"
    - "10:05 PM: Vector confronts Helena, argument, kills with levitated bookshelf"
    - "10:15 PM: Vector returns, stages scene, takes wand, erases log"
    - "10:30 PM: Body discovered officially"

  key_evidence:
    - id: "levitation_scorch_marks"
      why: "Proves Wingardium Leviosa used at high power (eliminates Adrian/Filch, implicates Vector/Flint)"
    - id: "erased_log_entry"
      why: "Proves Vector was there at 10:15 PM and covered it up"
    - id: "missing_wand_defensive_posture"
      why: "Proves Helena saw attack coming, Vector took wand to hide defensive magic evidence"
    - id: "adrian_heard_adult_voice"
      why: "From Adrian's testimony - proves Helena argued with adult, not peer (eliminates students)"

  deductions_required:
    - "Levitation scorch marks = high-power Wingardium Leviosa (Filch can't cast, Adrian too weak)"
    - "Erased log entry connects to Vector's presence at 10:15 PM"
    - "Missing wand = taken by killer to prevent Prior Incantato revealing defensive magic"
    - "Timeline eliminates Flint (left before 9 PM, scarf proves earlier presence only)"
    - "Adrian fled BEFORE crash (heard it, ran) = not the killer"
    - "Filch is squib = cannot cast Wingardium Leviosa"
    - "Vector's academic jealousy = professional threat (stronger motive than peer rivalry)"

  correct_reasoning_requires:
    - "Recognize scorch marks = Wingardium Leviosa at HIGH POWER (not physical push)"
    - "Connect erased log entry to Vector (only she had motive AND was in area)"
    - "Eliminate Flint (left before 9 PM, scarf proves earlier presence only)"
    - "Eliminate Filch (no magical ability for Wingardium Leviosa)"
    - "Eliminate Adrian (heard adult voice, his power level too weak for that shelf, fled before murder)"
    - "Understand Vector's academic jealousy as motive (professional threat, not peer rivalry)"

  common_mistakes:
    - error: "Accuse Flint"
      reason: "Obvious suspect, strong motive, scarf at scene"
      why_wrong: "Timeline wrong - left before 9 PM, scarf proves earlier presence only"
    - error: "Accuse Filch"
      reason: "Found body first, suspicious behavior, motive (humiliation)"
      why_wrong: "Squib - cannot cast Wingardium Leviosa (levitation scorch marks prove magic)"
    - error: "Accuse Adrian"
      reason: "Guilty behavior, followed her, stole notes, gave permission"
      why_wrong: "Fled BEFORE murder (heard crash, ran). Power level too weak for bookshelf. Heard adult voice (Helena argued with adult, not him)."
    - error: "Miss levitation evidence"
      reason: "Assumes physical shelf collapse, not magical"
      why_wrong: "Scorch marks prove Wingardium Leviosa used"
    - error: "Ignore erased log entry"
      reason: "Focuses on suspects with obvious motives"
      why_wrong: "Erased entry is key proof of Vector's presence and cover-up"

  fallacies_to_catch:
    - fallacy: "Confirmation bias"
      example: "Player locks onto Flint (obvious suspect) and ignores timeline evidence"
    - fallacy: "Appeal to authority"
      example: "Player assumes professor couldn't be guilty (authority figure bias)"
    - fallacy: "Correlation ≠ causation"
      example: "Player assumes scarf presence = guilt at time of death (ignores timeline)"

## Post-Verdict Scenes

### Wrong Suspect: Adrian Clearmont

```yaml
moody_response: |
  MOODY: "Clearmont? The PREFECT? Let me guess: he followed her, stole
  her notes, acted guilty. So he must be the killer, right?

  Wrong. He heard an ADULT voice arguing with Helena. He RAN when he
  heard the crash—before the murder, not after. And check the scorch
  marks: that level of Wingardium Leviosa? Adrian couldn't lift a
  CHAIR that high, let alone a bookshelf.

  Guilt doesn't equal murder, recruit. He's guilty of being a coward
  and a cheat. Not a killer. Think harder. {attempts_remaining}/10."
```

### Wrong Suspect: Marcus Flint

```yaml
moody_response: |
  MOODY: "FLINT? You're accusing a student of MURDER based on a scarf
  and an argument? Did you check the TIMELINE, recruit?

  His scarf proves he was there EARLIER. That's it. The shelf fell at
  10:05 PM. He was in his common room by then.

  You've got CONFIRMATION BIAS written all over this case. See suspicious
  person, ignore everything else. PATHETIC.

  Back to the evidence. {attempts_remaining}/10 attempts remaining."
```

### Wrong Suspect: Argus Filch

```yaml
moody_response: |
  MOODY: "Filch. You're accusing a SQUIB of a magical murder. Think about
  that for a second.

  Wingardium Leviosa powerful enough to lift a bookshelf? Filch can't
  even light a candle with magic. Yes, he behaved suspiciously—because
  he was TERRIFIED of being blamed. Fear isn't guilt.

  Use your HEAD. Check the magical evidence. {attempts_remaining}/10."
```

### Correct Suspect: Professor Vector

        eclipsed by a teenager who barely understood the foundational theory.

        I went to talk to her. To... to slow her down. Offer to collaborate—
        make it OUR discovery. She refused. Called me 'threatened' and
        'small-minded.'

    - speaker: "vector"
      line: |
        [Quiet, hollow]
        "I took her wand. I thought if there was no evidence of defensive
        magic... it would look like an accident. Just a shelf that fell.

        But you found the scorch marks. I should have known. Arithmancy
        never lies. The equations are always there, if you know where to look."

    - speaker: "moody"
      line: |
        [To player] "Good work, recruit. Take her to holding."

        [To Vector] "Fifteen years of research. And you threw it all away
        because you couldn't stand a student being smarter than you.
        Pathetic."

  aftermath:
    outcome: |
      Professor Vector is arrested and held for trial at the Wizengamot.
      Helena's research notes are turned over to the Department of Magical
      Research, where they credit her posthumously with advancing wandlore
      theory by a decade.

      The Restricted Section is closed for a week while new safety measures
      are implemented. Students hold a candlelight vigil for Helena in the
      library—Ravenclaws turn out in full, and even some Slytherins attend.

      Marcus Flint writes you a short note: "Thanks for not assuming I did it."

      Filch nods at you in the corridor the next day. For him, that's practically
      a thank-you speech.

    moody_final_word: |
      MOODY: "Case closed. {attempts_remaining}/10 attempts remaining.

      You identified the levitation evidence, traced the timeline, and didn't
      fall for the obvious suspect. That's acceptable work.

      But you hesitated when it came to a PROFESSOR. Remember: authority
      doesn't make someone innocent. Question everyone. CONSTANT VIGILANCE."

### Moody's Rationality Lesson (Case 1)

```yaml
briefing:
  moody_teaches: |
    MOODY: "Right. Before you even LOOK at the specific evidence in this
    case, answer me this—

    Out of 100 student deaths at Hogwarts ruled 'accidents,' how many
    actually ARE accidents? Not murders in disguise. Just... accidents."

  player_guess:
    prompt: "Your estimate?"
    options:
      - "10-20% (Most are actually murders)"
      - "40-60% (About half and half)"
      - "80-90% (Most are genuine accidents)"
      - "I don't know"

  moody_response_correct: |
    "85%. Not bad. You're thinking."

  moody_response_wrong_low: |
    "10%? You've been reading too many mystery novels, recruit."

  moody_all_paths_continue: |
    "85%. Eighty-five percent. Hogwarts is DANGEROUS. Moving staircases.
    Cursed artifacts. Students experimenting with magic they barely
    understand. Forbidden Forest full of things that want to eat them.

    Most of the time? An accident is just an accident.

    [Taps the case file]

    So THAT'S where you start with Helena Blackwood. Probably an accident.
    Tragic, but straightforward. Then you look at the EVIDENCE. Maybe it
    changes your mind. Maybe it doesn't.

    But you don't go looking for murder because it's more INTERESTING.
    You go looking for TRUTH—even if the truth is boring.

    [Magical eye swivels to fix on you]

    Start with what's LIKELY. Let evidence tell you if you're wrong.
    That's the first rule. Remember it."

  tutorial_briefing: |
    MOODY: "Right. Investigation fundamentals. Pay attention.

    EXPLORATION: You can go anywhere in the crime scene. Examine anything.
    Ask about anything. Type what you want to investigate—I'm not holding
    your hand with a list of 'correct' actions.

    SPELLS: You have basic investigation spells. I'll teach you as needed.
    Start with REVELIO—reveals hidden objects and magical traces. Point your
    wand, say 'Revelio,' and pay attention to what it shows you.

    EVIDENCE: When you find something important, you'll know. It gets logged
    automatically. Check your evidence board anytime to review what you've found.

    WITNESSES: People lie. People forget. People see what they want to see.
    Your job is to figure out which. Press them. Show them evidence. Make
    them PROVE their story.

    VERDICT: When you think you know who did it and WHY, you submit to me.
    Name the culprit. Explain your reasoning. If you're wrong, I'll tell you.
    You get ten attempts. Use them wisely.

    [Stands, magical eye spinning]

    Questions?"

        MOODY: "Good instinct. Always check what's NOT at eye level."

      tutorial_moment: |
        MOODY: "Revelio reveals hidden objects and magical residue. Point
        your wand and say 'Revelio.' Works on areas or specific objects.

        Remember: magic leaves traces. CONSTANT VIGILANCE."

      narration: |
        Your wand movement reveals a shimmer behind the desk. You pull out
        a green Slytherin scarf, hastily shoved out of sight. Silver embroidery:
        'M.F.'—Marcus Flint.

      reason: "Wand is missing (taken by killer)"
      narration: |
        You search Helena's robes, her hands, the surrounding area. Her wand
        isn't here. That's... unusual. Students don't drop their wands, especially
        not in the Restricted Section where they need light.

        TOM: "Missing wand. Taken by killer? Or did it fall somewhere?"

      tutorial_moment: |
        MOODY: "Prior Incantato shows a wand's last spells. But you need the
        PHYSICAL WAND. Can't cast it on thin air, recruit."

      flints_wand_result: "Lumos, Alohomora, Lumos (nothing suspicious)"

      reveals: "No one currently hiding in library"
      narration: |
        You cast Homenum Revelio, the detection spell spreading through the
        library. The spell returns empty—whoever was here is long gone.

        MOODY: "Homenum Revelio detects hidden persons. Useful for searching
        large areas. But it only shows you WHO'S HERE NOW. Doesn't tell you
        who WAS here."

      tutorial_moment: |
        MOODY: "Homenum Revelio—detects living humans in the area. Won't find
        ghosts, portraits, or animals. And it's NOW, not the past. Remember that."

  specialis_revelio:

      works: true
      reveals: "Standard lamp oil, nothing suspicious"
      narration: |
        You point your wand at the spilled oil. "Specialis Revelio."

        The spell identifies it: standard lamp oil, no poisons, no magical
        enhancement. The lantern broke when the shelf fell—collateral damage,
        not evidence.

      tutorial_moment: |
        MOODY: "Specialis Revelio identifies potions and substances. Useful
        for poisons, unknown liquids, or checking if something's been tampered
        with. Doesn't work on people—only substances."
