Without a clear search direction, you're lost in the storm, grasping at fragments of memory that slip through your fingers like smoke, finding nothing but her defenses growing sharper and more hostile. You recoil from her mind with a jolt, your connection severing violently, leaving you gasping and disoriented. Hermione pulls away from you, her eyes blazing with indignation and suspicion, her voice cold: \"Did you just try to *use* Legilimency on me without consent, without even asking?\"",

The connection fragments immediately, scattering like broken glass, leaving you gasping and disoriented while Draco's eyes snap wide with violation, his face flushing with dangerous anger. You withdraw hastily, your probe repelled entirely, gaining nothing but the certainty that you've just made him far less inclined to cooperate. His hand drifts toward his wand as he steps back, jaw clenched, the accusation burning unspoken between you both.",
