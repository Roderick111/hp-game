He's made it perfectly clear what happens to people who cross him, and I couldn't bear the thought of what his father might do. *takes a deep breath* But you're right to push me on this. I should have come forward immediately.",

It's rather difficult to say much without knowing precisely what you're investigating, though I suppose it does seem rather suspicious that someone felt the need to hide it in the first place.
