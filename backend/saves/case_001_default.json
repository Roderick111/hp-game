The glass, etched with intricate patterns of frost, appears to be more than just a simple result of the winter chill outside; the delicate, lace-like designs radiate from a central point on the floor, near where Snape's outstretched hand lies.\n\nUpon closer inspection, you notice that the frost patterns are not random; they seem to be centered around a spot on the floor, as if something there had been emitting a chilling aura. The air around this area feels heavy with a malevolent presence, and you can't help but wonder what could have caused such an unusual display of frost.\n\nUsing your knowledge of magical phenomena, you decide to take a closer look. As you examine the frost more carefully, the magical residue becomes apparent, and you detect the faint signature of dark magic\u2014specifically, the residual trace of a Hand of Glory, a cursed object known to emit a petrification curse when handled improperly. The object itself is gone, but its magical aura lingers, frozen in the glass and etched into your memory. [EVIDENCE: frost_pattern]",

It's a well-known textbook, but its presence here, alongside more sinister tomes, seems out of place.
