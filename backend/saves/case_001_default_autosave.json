She watched him\u2014her brilliant mind catalogued every detail of the frost pattern blooming across the glass, recognized the distinctive signature of his magic in those crystalline formations. But beneath this memory runs a darker current: shame and terror. She saw him. She *knows* what he was doing. Yet fear of retaliation has sealed her lips, a conflict that wars within her orderly, truth-loving mind. Deeper still, you glimpse another secret struggling to surface\u2014a forbidden book, borrowed in desperation for an essay, returned before the incident but still gnawing at her conscience with the weight of rule-breaking guilt.\n\n[EVIDENCE: saw_draco]\n\nYou withdraw gently from her consciousness, pulling the silver threads back through your wand like retracting a fishing line.
