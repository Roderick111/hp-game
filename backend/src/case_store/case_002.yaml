  id: "case_002"
  title: "The Restricted Section"
  difficulty: "advanced"
  description: "A brilliant student is found crushed in the Restricted Section. A tragic accident, or a 15-year lie finally unraveling?"
  crime_type: "murder"
  hook: "A bookshelf fell in the night. Helena Blackwood is dead. But books don't fall by themselves in the Restricted Section."
  twist: "The 'accident' was staged to hide a career-defining fraud. Helena came to save her mentor, not expose her—but Vector killed the one student who still believed in her."

  # VICTIM
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  victim:
    name: "Helena Blackwood"
    age: "Fourth-year Ravenclaw"
    humanization: |
      You remember her from the library—her silver Ravenclaw diadem
      catching the light as she scribbled frantically, humming arithmancy
      sequences under her breath. For three years, she idolized Professor
      Vector, spending every Tuesday evening in her office extending the
      famous 1991 theorem. She wasn't trying to expose a fraud—she was
      trying to honor her mentor by building on her work. When she found
      the flaw, she cried not from fear, but from heartbreak. She went
      to Vector to fix it together, to save the legacy she'd spent years
      celebrating. That devotion killed her.
    memorable_trait: "Always hummed complex arithmancy patterns while studying"
    time_of_death: "10:05 PM"
    cause_of_death: "Crushed by a massive bookshelf (staged as accident)"

      name: "Professor Septima Vector"
      personality: |
        Professional and composed, though she looks tired. She answers 
        questions precisely, almost mechanically. There's a distance to 
        her—not coldness exactly, but the manner of someone compartmentalizing 
        grief in order to function.
      wants: "Maintain control of the situation and her reputation."
      fears: "The loss of her professional standing."
      moral_complexity: |
        Vector mentored Helena for three years. She saw herself in the
        girl—brilliant, obsessive, hungry to understand. Every Tuesday
        evening, Helena came to her office, and Vector felt pride watching
        her extend the theorem. When Helena came that night saying, "We
        can fix this together," Vector's first instinct was gratitude that
        her protégé wanted to protect her. Then fear. Then cold calculation.
        She killed the potential she'd nurtured. She tells herself it was
        necessary—a variable corrected, a system preserved. But she sees
        Helena's face: not fear, but disappointment. "Professor, how could
        you lie for fifteen years?" Vector didn't kill a threat. She killed
        someone who believed in her.

        Anxious and frail. He has ink stains on his bitten fingernails

        Restricted Section, his eyes darting to the shadows. He speaks 
        quickly, as if trying to get the words out before he's silenced.
      wants: "To get through this without Vector discovering he has the manuscript copies."
      fears: "Vector knows about the copies and will come for him next. He's a witness and evidence holder—he's a liability."
      moral_complexity: |
        Adrian and Helena were research partners investigating the fraud
        together. He wanted to expose Vector immediately; Helena insisted
        on giving her mentor a chance. They fought about it three days ago.
        Helena gave him manuscript copies for safekeeping, hidden in his
        trunk. When he heard the crash, Adrian ran—not because he's a
        coward, but because Helena had made him promise: "If something
        happens to me, get those copies to Dumbledore." He failed her. The
        copies are still hidden. He's paralyzed between honoring Helena's
        sacrifice and protecting himself. He's not a hero; he's a terrified
        student who watched his friend die from the shadows.

        Marcus thought it was easy money—50 Galleons to create a loud,
        flashy duel in the alcove at 10 PM. "A prank on Pince," Helena
        said. He didn't ask questions. Then he heard the crash. He has
        Helena's envelope—sealed, addressed to Dumbledore, with instructions
        to deliver it at 10:30 "if she doesn't return." He froze. A girl
        died, and he's holding evidence she knew it might happen. He should
        have delivered it. But he panicked. Now it's been days. He's terrified
        that delivering it late makes him look guilty, but keeping it makes
        him complicit. He's not evil—he's a kid who took money for what he
        thought was a harmless favor and ended up with blood money and a
        dead girl's last words in his pocket.

            Helena paid me. Fifty Galleons. She said it was for a prank—
            create a loud, flashy duel at exactly 10 PM to distract Madam
            Pince. I thought it was brilliant. Easy money for something I'd
            do for free anyway. Then I heard the crash. I didn't know. I
            swear I didn't know what she was really planning.

            She gave me an envelope. Sealed. Addressed to Dumbledore. She
            said, 'If I'm not back by 10:30, deliver this. Don't open it.'
            I thought she was being dramatic. Then she died. I still have it.
            I've carried it for days. I'm too scared to deliver it now—what
            if they think I was part of it? What if it says something that

        Helena caught Filch with his Kwikspell correspondence two months
        ago. Instead of reporting him, she promised silence in exchange for
        Restricted Section access on Tuesday nights. She said, "I know what
        it's like to feel inadequate, Mr. Filch." She was kind to him. When
        he found her body at 10:07, he felt genuine grief. Then Vector
        emerged from the shadows, saw him standing over Helena, and said,
        "I'll tell Dumbledore about your Kwikspell letters unless you help
        me clean this up." Filch helped the woman who killed the girl who'd
        been kind to him. He's not malicious—he's pathetic, desperate, and
        drowning in guilt. Every time he mops the library floors, he sees

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # SOLUTION
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  solution:
    culprit: "professor_vector"
    method: "Used high-power Wingardium Leviosa to position and drop a bookshelf on Helena. Staged it as an accident, then blackmailed Filch into cleaning the scene."
    motive: "Career survival and betrayal. Helena, her mentee of three years, discovered Vector's 1991 theorem was fraudulent. Helena came to help fix it quietly, but Vector panicked and killed the one person who still believed in her."
    key_evidence:
      - "helena_last_spell_lumos"
      - "scribbled_scrap"
      - "levitation_scorch_marks"
      - "erased_log_entry"
      - "helena_journal"
      - "research_notes_partnership"
    deductions_required:
      - "Helena's last spell (Lumos) proves she wasn't manipulating the shelf—rules out accident."
      - "Scorch marks require high magical power—eliminates students (Adrian, Marcus) and Filch (Squib)."
      - "Helena's journal proves she anticipated danger and distributed evidence (Adrian has copies, Marcus has envelope)."
      - "Erased log shows THREE names—Vector tried to obscure the timeline and implicate others."
      - "Research notes prove Adrian and Helena were partners investigating together—he's a witness, not a killer."
      - "Marcus was paid by Helena for distraction—he's unwittingly complicit, not the murderer."
      - "Filch helped Helena access Restricted Section—explains his guilt and Vector's leverage for blackmail."
    correct_reasoning_requires:
      - "Understanding Helena wanted to PROTECT Vector (offer to fix fraud together), not expose her."
      - "Recognizing the three-year mentor relationship made the betrayal deeply personal."
      - "Distinguishing between multiple types of magic: duel (clove residue), murder (levitation scorch), illumination (Lumos)."
      - "Following the web: Helena → Adrian (copies), Helena → Marcus (envelope), Helena → Filch (access), Vector → Filch (blackmail)."
    common_mistakes:
      - error: "Accuse Marcus Flint"
        reason: "Present at scene, dark artifact, took Helena's money, name erased from log."
        why_wrong: "Helena PAID him for distraction (note proves it). He's holding her envelope for Dumbledore. Insufficient power for shelf levitation. No motive to kill her—she was his benefactor."
      - error: "Accuse Adrian Clearmont"
        reason: "Present at scene, fled immediately, terrified and guilty-acting, has manuscript evidence."
        why_wrong: "Research partners with Helena (notes prove it). She GAVE him copies for safekeeping. He fled because she told him to protect the evidence if something happened. Insufficient power for levitation. No motive—they were working together."
      - error: "Accuse Argus Filch"
        reason: "Found body first, cleaned crime scene, erased log entries, acting guilty."
        why_wrong: "Squib—cannot cast levitation spell (scorch marks require magic). Helena helped him (arrangement note). He was blackmailed by Vector AFTER finding the body. He's complicit in cover-up, not murder."
      - error: "Accept accident theory"
        reason: "Dangerous location, heavy books, student alone at night."
        why_wrong: "Shelf was deliberately positioned (scuff marks). Helena only cast Lumos (not levitation). High-power scorch marks prove external magic. Vector erased log to hide her presence."
    fallacies_to_catch:
      - fallacy: "authority_bias"
        example: "Refusing to suspect Vector because 'Professors don't murder students' or 'She mentored Helena, she must have cared.'"
      - fallacy: "guilt_by_association"
        example: "Accusing Marcus because he took Helena's money, ignoring that she paid him for a legitimate service (distraction)."
      - fallacy: "surface_guilt"
        example: "Accusing Adrian because he's terrified and fled, ignoring that witnesses often flee from trauma and he had explicit instructions from Helena to protect evidence."

      aftermath: |
        Professor Vector was arrested and her fifteen-year fraud exposed to
        the academic community. Helena's posthumous correction of the Vector
        Theorem—completed by Adrian Clearmont from her notes—changed
        Arithmancy forever. The revised theorem is now taught as the
        "Blackwood Correction."

        Argus Filch kept his job, but Dumbledore learned of his Kwikspell
        correspondence. Instead of firing him, Dumbledore quietly arranged
        for private tutoring. Filch refused.

        Adrian Clearmont delivered Helena's manuscript copies to Dumbledore,
        fulfilling his promise to his friend. He speaks at her memorial,
        voice shaking but clear.

        Marcus Flint delivered the sealed envelope. Inside: Helena's complete
        proof of Vector's fraud, and a note: "If you're reading this, I
        didn't come back. Please make sure Professor Vector gets help. She
        made a mistake fifteen years ago, and I think it's been eating at
        her ever since. —H.B."

        Even in death, Helena tried to save her mentor.

          MOODY: "Flint? You're chasing a schoolyard duelist while a KILLER
          sits in the staff room! Yes, Helena paid him. Yes, he's holding her
          envelope. But THINK—why would she give evidence to her own killer?
          She TRUSTED him to deliver it if she died. He was her insurance, not
          her enemy.

          The clove residue is from dueling, not murder. Look at the POWER,
          recruit. Look at who had HIGH-LEVEL magic. Flint can barely manage
          a Summoning Charm.

          CONSTANT VIGILANCE!"

          MOODY: "Clearmont? He's terrified, he fled, he has the manuscript

          Helena GAVE him those copies three days before she died. They were
          investigating TOGETHER. Their handwriting's on the same research
          notes—did you find those? They argued about whether to expose
          Vector, but Helena won. She wanted to protect her mentor.

          Clearmont fled because Helena told him to—'Protect the evidence if
          something happens.' He's following her orders, not running from guilt.
          And the scorch marks? That's advanced magic. Fourth-year student
          can't levitate a bookshelf that precisely.

          Dig deeper, recruit. Who had the POWER and the DESPERATION?"
        why_innocent: "Research partners with Helena (notes prove collaboration). She gave him manuscript copies for safekeeping, not because he stole them. Insufficient magical power for precise bookshelf levitation. No motive—they were working together toward the same goal."

          Leviosa. Filch couldn't levitate a feather if his life depended on
          it. And Helena HELPED him—that arrangement note proves it. She kept
          his Kwikspell secret. Why would he kill someone who showed him
          kindness?

          He's guilty of being a coward. Of letting Vector blackmail him into
          covering up. But murder? He didn't have the means. Find someone who
          had MAGIC and MOTIVE.

          Think!"
        why_innocent: "Squib—cannot cast the levitation spell required (scorch marks prove high-level magic was used). Helena helped him by keeping his Kwikspell secret. He was blackmailed by Vector AFTER the murder to clean up. Complicit in cover-up, not the killing."
