  id: "case_002"
  title: "The Restricted Section"
  difficulty: "advanced"
  description: "A brilliant student is found crushed in the Restricted Section. A tragic accident, or a 15-year lie finally unraveling?"
  crime_type: "murder"
  hook: "A bookshelf fell in the night. Helena Blackwood is dead. But books don't fall by themselves in the Restricted Section."
  twist: "The 'accident' was staged to hide a career-defining fraud. The killer feared the victim's help more than her rivalry."

  # VICTIM
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  victim:
    name: "Helena Blackwood"
    age: "Fourth-year Ravenclaw"
    humanization: |
      You remember her from the library—her silver Ravenclaw diadem 
      catching the light as she scribbled frantically. She wasn't just 
      bright; she had found a flaw in the foundations of modern Arithmancy. 
      A light that burned too bright for some, now snuffed out in the 
      darkness of the Restricted Section.
    memorable_trait: "Always hummed complex arithmancy patterns while studying"
    time_of_death: "10:05 PM"
    cause_of_death: "Crushed by a massive bookshelf (staged as accident)"

        The hall is silent, save for the rhythmic, unsettling tick of a

        stretch between the towering shelves. Madam Pince's office door

  witnesses:
    - id: "professor_vector"
      name: "Professor Septima Vector"
      personality: |
        Professional and composed, though she looks tired. She answers 
        questions precisely, almost mechanically. There's a distance to 
        her—not coldness exactly, but the manner of someone compartmentalizing 
        grief in order to function.
      wants: "Maintain control of the situation and her reputation."
      fears: "The loss of her professional standing."
      moral_complexity: |
        Vector isn't a monster in her own eyes; she's a pragmatist. 
        She spent fifteen years building a foundation for Arithmancy. 
        Helena's discovery threatened to undo all of it. Vector killed 
        not out of malice, but to 'correct' a variable that would have 
        collapsed the system. She feels a cold, logical regret.
      base_trust: 60
      occlumency_skill: 85
      knowledge:
        - "Helena was 'confused' about recent Arithmancy proofs."
        - "Claimed to be in her office grading papers all night."

    - id: "adrian_clearmont"
      name: "Adrian Clearmont"
      personality: |
        Anxious and frail. He has ink stains on his bitten fingernails 
        and flinches at loud noises. He refuses to look toward the 
        Restricted Section, his eyes darting to the shadows. He speaks 
        quickly, as if trying to get the words out before he's silenced.
      wants: "To get through the interrogation without implicating himself."
      fears: "That Vector knows he saw her."
      moral_complexity: |
        Adrian is terrified. He's not a hero; he's a student who got 
        caught in something too big for him. He feels guilty about 
        Helena, but his survival instinct is screaming at him to stay 
        quiet. He's a realistic portrait of fear, not villainy.
      base_trust: 40
      knowledge:
        - "Heard Vector and Helena arguing about 'the manuscript' at 10 PM."

            I was there! Behind the shelf. I heard them. Helena was 
            crying—not because she was scared, but because she was 
            disappointed. She said, 'Professor, how could you lie for 
            fifteen years?' Then... I heard a sliding sound. A heavy, 
            magical sliding. And then the scream. I ran. I'm sorry, 
            I just ran!

      name: "Marcus Flint"
      personality: |
        Defensive and sullen. He has a smudge of soot on his jaw and 
        smells faintly of sweat. He leans back with forced bravado, 
        but his eyes are wary. He treats this investigation like a 
        teacher catching him out of bed—annoying, but not dangerous.
      wants: "To hide his involvement in the duel."
      fears: "Expulsion for using Dark Artifacts."
      moral_complexity: |
        Marcus is just a student who broke the rules at the worst 
        possible time. He feels bad about Helena, in a vague way, but 
        mostly he's worried about his own skin. He represents the 
        mundane rule-breaking that happens at Hogwarts, contrasting 
        with the dark reality of the murder.
      base_trust: 30

      name: "Argus Filch"
      personality: |
        Obsessive and haunted. He polishes the same spot on the floor 
        repeatedly, his knuckles white. He refuses to meet your eyes, 
        staring at the stone as if he can still see the stains he cleaned. 
        He flinches noticeably whenever Vector is mentioned.
      wants: "To keep his head down and his job safe."
      fears: "Vector's blackmail and Dumbledore's disappointment."
      moral_complexity: |
        Filch is a man trapped. He cleaned the scene because he was 
        terrified of losing the only home he has. He's not malicious; 
        he's pathetic and desperate. His silence is bought with the 
        threat of his own ruin.

            looked so small. Vector made me mop the marks. Made me

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # SOLUTION
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  solution:
    culprit: "professor_vector"
    method: "Used high-power Wingardium Leviosa to drop a shelf on Helena while she was distracted. Staged it as an accident while she was searching for books."
    motive: "Career survival. Helena discovered the manuscript proving Vector's Arithmancy theorem was a fabrication. Vector killed her and tried to destroy the manuscript to preserve her 15-year reputation."
    key_evidence:
      - "helena_last_spell_lumos"
      - "scribbled_scrap"
      - "levitation_scorch_marks"
      - "erased_log_entry"
    deductions_required:
      - "Helena's last spell (Lumos) proves she wasn't doing anything dangerous, ruling out a self-inflicted accident."
      - "The high magical power in the scorch marks eliminates the students and the non-magical Filch."
      - "The scribbled scrap provides the missing piece of the puzzle: a motive powerful enough for a Professor to kill."
      - "Filch's suspicious timeline and Vector's erased log entry connect the cleanup to the perpetrator."
    correct_reasoning_requires:
      - "Identifying the specific 'Manuscript Fraud' motive as being more desperate than simple academic rivalry."
      - "Distinguishing between the duelist's 'clove' magic and the killer's high-power levitation."
    common_mistakes:
      - error: "Accuse Marcus Flint"
        reason: "He was hiding in the alcove and has a dark artifact."
        why_wrong: "The residue is cloves (duel), not levitation. He lacked the motive for Helena's research."
      - error: "Accuse Adrian Clearmont"
        reason: "He was near the scene and is clearly terrified/guilty."
        why_wrong: "He's a witness, not a killer. His magic isn't strong enough for the shelf."
    fallacies_to_catch:
      - fallacy: "authority_bias"
        example: "Ignoring the log erasures because 'Professors are above such things.'"

      aftermath: |
        Professor Vector was arrested and the truth of her fraud exposed. 
        Helena's posthumous correction of the Vector Theorem changed the 
        field forever. Filch kept his job but with a permanent stain on 
        his record. Adrian Clearmont eventually found his voice, and 
        Marcus Flint's dueling days were over—at least on school grounds.
