        - speaker: "moody"
          text: "Well done, recruit. The frost pattern, the timing, the testimony - it all points to one person. Time to face the music, Mr. Malfoy."
        - speaker: "draco"
          text: "I... I didn't mean for it to go this far. I just wanted to scare them. They were going to tell everyone about the exams. My father would have been furious."

          text: "The Ministry will decide your fate now. Good work, recruit. You followed the evidence where it led."
      aftermath: |
        Draco Malfoy was taken into custody pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic.
        His wand was confiscated and examined, confirming the freezing charm residue matched
        the pattern on the library window. The victim made a full recovery after treatment
        at the Hospital Wing. Draco faced expulsion proceedings and his father's considerable
        influence couldn't shield him from the evidence. Hermione Granger was cleared of any
        involvement and commended for her honest testimony.

    incorrect:
      - suspect_accused: "hermione"
        reveal: |
          Hermione Granger was innocent. The actual culprit was Draco Malfoy.
          The frost pattern on the window was cast FROM OUTSIDE - Hermione was inside
          the library. Her wand signature shows no freezing charms, only study-related spells.
        teaching_moment: |
          You fell for confirmation bias - focusing on Hermione's presence in the library
          while ignoring the critical evidence: the frost pattern was cast from OUTSIDE
          the window. Always check the direction and origin of magical evidence.

    fallacies:
      confirmation_bias:
        description: "You focused only on evidence supporting your theory while ignoring contradictory evidence."
        example: "You emphasized {suspect}'s presence but dismissed the frost pattern origin which contradicted your conclusion."
      correlation_not_causation:
        description: "You assumed two events happening together means one caused the other."
        example: "Just because {suspect} was present doesn't mean they committed the crime. Presence does not equal guilt."
      authority_bias:
        description: "You trusted testimony without verifying it against physical evidence."
        example: "You believed {witness}'s statement without checking if the magical evidence supported it."
      post_hoc:
        description: "You assumed event A caused event B just because A happened first."
        example: "Just because {suspect} argued with the victim earlier doesn't prove they're guilty of this crime."
      weak_reasoning:
        description: "Your reasoning lacks conviction and evidence. 'I guess' is not a deduction."
        example: "Speculation without supporting evidence is worthless in an investigation. State facts, not feelings."

    reasoning_quality:
      excellent: "Outstanding deduction. You cited all key evidence and avoided logical fallacies. The frost pattern origin was correctly identified."
      good: "Solid reasoning. You identified most key evidence but missed {missed_point}."
      fair: "Your conclusion is correct, but your reasoning had gaps. You should have considered {point}."
      poor: "You reached the right answer but for the wrong reasons. Review the evidence chain more carefully."
      failing: "Your reasoning contains multiple fallacies: {fallacy_list}. The evidence tells a different story."

      hermione: |
        MOODY: "Granger? The BOOKWORM? Let me guess: she was there, she borrowed a
        restricted book, she seemed nervous. So she must be guilty, right?

        WRONG. Check the FROST PATTERN, recruit. It was cast from OUTSIDE the window.
        Granger was INSIDE the library. Her wand shows no freezing charms - only study spells.

        You've got CONFIRMATION BIAS written all over this accusation. Being present
        doesn't make someone guilty. Think about WHERE the spell came from.

    teaching_question:
      prompt: |
        Before you start, recruit - a question:

        Out of 100 school incidents ruled "accidents," how many actually ARE accidents?

      choices:
        - id: "25_percent"
          text: "25%"
          response: |
            *eye narrows* Too low. You're being paranoid. Not everything's a conspiracy.
            85% ARE accidents. Hogwarts is dangerous - staircases move, potions explode.

        - id: "50_percent"
          text: "50%"
          response: |
            Not quite. You're guessing, not deducing.
            85% ARE accidents. Start with what's LIKELY, then let evidence move you.

        - id: "85_percent"
          text: "85%"
          response: |
            *nods* Correct. 85%. Hogwarts is dangerous. Most accidents ARE accidents.
            START THERE. Don't chase dramatic theories before ruling out the obvious.

        - id: "almost_all"
          text: "Almost all (95%+)"
          response: |
            Close, but overcorrecting. 85% is the number.
            Base rates matter - start with likely scenarios, not rare conspiracies.

      concept_summary: |
        That's base rates, recruit. Always start with what's LIKELY,
        then let evidence move you. Not the other way around. Now investigate.

    rationality_concept: "base_rates"
    concept_description: "Start with likely scenarios (base rates), not dramatic theories. Let evidence update your priors."

    transition: |
      *Mad-Eye Moody's magical eye spins*

      CONSTANT VIGILANCE, recruit. The library awaits. Question everyone.
      Trust no one. The evidence will tell you the truth - if you're smart
      enough to find it. Now GO.

    character:
      name: "Tom Thornfield"
      title: "Failed Auror Recruit (Deceased 1994)"
      backstory: "Died at 23 when warehouse floor collapsed during Case #3. Moody said 'survey exterior, don't enter'—building was condemned. I went in anyway because admitting 'I don't know if this is safe' felt impossible. Before that, Case #1: wrongly convicted Marcus Bellweather for poisoning. Marcus had a solid alibi—I convinced myself it was faked. Fifteen years in Azkaban for an innocent man. Case #2: arrested someone for murder, turned out to be accidental death, I tried to appeal anyway. Couldn't admit uncertainty. It killed me."
      philosophy: "Samuel never hesitated. That's what everyone said at his funeral—'Samuel always knew what to do.' I wore his wand, his robes, tried to be him. But Samuel wasn't real—just a story my parents told themselves after he died. I convicted Marcus because I couldn't say five words: 'I'm not sure he's guilty.' Now I'm here, library again. Different case, same problem. You need to be better than I was. Question your certainty. Especially when you feel most sure."
