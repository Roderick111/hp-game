case:
  id: "case_001"
  title: "The Restricted Section"
  difficulty: beginner
  description: "Professor Snape found petrified in the Restricted Section. Three people had reasons to be there that night. Who's telling the truth?"

  # Phase 5.5: Case identity
  crime_type: "assault"
  hook: "A brilliant professor frozen by dark magic. The student who found him has secrets. So does everyone else."
  twist: "Not everyone with secrets is guilty. Not every accident is innocent. The truth lies between intention and consequence."

  # Phase 5.5: Victim humanization
  victim:
    name: "Severus Snape"
    age: "Potions Master, Head of Slytherin House"
    humanization: |
      The most feared professor at Hogwarts—harsh, unforgiving, brilliant.
      That morning, he discovered potion ingredients missing from his private stores.
      By evening, he was frozen in the Restricted Section, arm outstretched toward something on the floor.
      Even Snape didn't deserve this.
    memorable_trait: "Never forgets a slight, never shows mercy to rule-breakers"
    time_of_death: "10:00 PM"
    cause_of_death: "Petrification curse from Hand of Glory discharge"

        The Restricted Section after hours. Ancient tomes line dark oak shelves,
        their spines etched with warnings. A reading desk holds scattered parchments—
        Defense Against the Dark Arts essays, judging by the titles. Near the frost-covered
        window, Professor Snape lies motionless, his black robes pooled around him.
        His right arm is outstretched, reaching for something. His expression: not anger, but shock.

        Brilliant, rule-conscious, but fiercely loyal to friends. Speaks quickly when nervous.
        Defensive when accused, but also deeply moral—she'll confess to rule-breaking if it's
        the right thing to do. Terrified of expulsion.

      background: |
        Third-year Gryffindor, top of her class. Recently she's been helping Neville Longbottom
        learn defensive spells after he was bullied by Slytherins. This is technically against
        school rules (students aren't allowed to teach each other combat magic).

        Hermione was in the wrong place at the wrong time. She found Snape's body while
        researching defensive spells for Neville's lessons. Now her library badge is at the
        scene, making her look guilty. She knows she's innocent, but she can't fully explain
        why she was there without getting Neville in trouble. Should she tell the whole truth
        and risk Neville's expulsion? Or withhold details and look suspicious?

      background: |
        Third-year Slytherin, pure-blood aristocrat. His father sent him a Hand of Glory
        to "impress housemates" and "demonstrate proper wizarding heritage." Draco wanted

        confiscate it—Draco didn't mean to hurt anyone. Now he's faced with an impossible
        choice: confess to an accident and face expulsion (and his father's rage), or
        stay silent and let an innocent person take the blame. He's not evil, just a
        scared teenager in way over his head.

        Stern but fair, Deputy Headmistress. Speaks formally, measured words. Deeply committed
        to student welfare but also to justice. Troubled by this case—she sees it as a tragedy
        of teenage recklessness, not evil.

      background: |
        Deputy Headmistress, Head of Gryffindor House. She was on patrol that night after
        Snape reported the potion ingredient theft. She's torn between her duty to punish
        wrongdoing and her sympathy for students who make terrible mistakes.

      # Phase 5.5: Psychological depth
      wants: "See justice served, but also protect students from destroying their futures over a tragic accident"
      fears: "An innocent student being punished, a guilty student escaping justice, failing in her duty"
      moral_complexity: |
        McGonagall knows something terrible happened, but she also sees nuance. If Draco
        is guilty, should he be expelled for an accident? If Hermione was breaking rules
        to help a bullied student, should she be punished? McGonagall must balance justice
        with mercy, rules with compassion. She wants the truth, but she also wants to
        believe her students are redeemable.

  solution:

    motive: "Teenage recklessness—wanted to impress housemates with dark artifact, never intended harm"

    key_evidence:
      - "frost_pattern"      # Hand of Glory discharge signature
      - "torn_letter"        # Connects Hand of Glory to Draco

      - "muddy_footprints"   # Trail leads to Slytherin

      - "Draco fled immediately after the discharge (scuff marks + timeline)"
      - "Hermione discovered body after attack (timeline clears her)"
      - "Dobby's theft was unrelated to attack (different crime, different timeline)"

    correct_reasoning_requires:
      - "Physical evidence (Hand of Glory) trumps circumstantial evidence (Hermione's badge)"
      - "Timeline eliminates suspects with alibis (Hermione found body AFTER attack)"
      - "Multiple people having secrets doesn't mean they're all guilty"
      - "Dobby's theft created context for Snape's mood, but didn't cause the attack"
      - "Accident vs intention matters for moral judgment, but Draco is still responsible"

        Hermione Granger was a witness, not the perpetrator. The timeline proves she entered
        the Restricted Section AFTER Snape was already frozen. Her library badge fell when
        she discovered the body and panicked. She was breaking school rules by researching
        combat magic for Neville, but this is entirely separate from the attack on Snape.

      common_mistakes:

    - id: "dobby"
      why_innocent: |
        Dobby the house-elf stole potion ingredients days before Snape's attack. The apology
        note connects him to the theft, but not to the assault. House-elf magic cannot produce
        the dark curse signature left by a Hand of Glory. Dobby confessed the theft to McGonagall
        after the attack and has an alibi. The theft created tension between Dobby and Snape,
        but the two incidents are unrelated.

      common_mistakes:
        - "Had conflict with Snape over ingredient theft"
        - "Note signed 'D.' could mean Draco or Dobby"
        - "Motive: Snape threatened him over theft"

      exoneration_evidence:
        - "House-elf magic can't create Hand of Glory discharge (different magical signature)"
        - "Theft happened 3 days before attack (separate incident)"

      aftermath: |
        Draco Malfoy was expelled from Hogwarts for possession and reckless use of a
        dark artifact resulting in serious harm to a professor. Snape was revived after
        three days in the Hospital Wing. Hermione Granger received a formal reprimand
        for after-hours Restricted Section access but was praised for immediately reporting
        the crime scene. Neville Longbottom was never implicated in the secret lessons.

        Dobby the house-elf was pardoned for the ingredient theft after McGonagall explained
        he was trying to help a sick friend. Lucius Malfoy threatened legal action but
        quietly withdrew when evidence of his involvement (the letter) became public record.

        The case became a cautionary tale: recklessness with dark magic has consequences,
        even without evil intent. Teenage bravado nearly cost a life.

          MOODY: "Hermione Granger entered the Restricted Section at 10:05 PM. Snape was
          attacked at 10:00 PM. She couldn't have frozen him if he was already frozen when
          she arrived. Her badge fell when she discovered the body and panicked—witness
          behavior, not criminal behavior."

          *taps the scroll*

          MOODY: "The REAL culprit was Draco Malfoy. Student testimony places him leaving
          Slytherin common room at 9:45 PM with a wrapped object. I saw him returning at
          10:15 PM, terrified. His father's letter proves he received a Hand of Glory—the
          weapon that left that frost pattern. The curse signature matches. Timeline matches.
          Physical evidence matches."

          *fixes you with both eyes*

          MOODY: "You ignored the physical evidence because circumstantial evidence looked

          because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time."

        teaching_moment: |
          You made a classic mistake: assuming the person who found the body is guilty.
          This is "availability bias"—the most obvious suspect isn't always the right one.

          The timeline proved Hermione arrived AFTER the crime. Her presence at the scene
          was explainable (she had a library badge for approved after-hours research).
          The physical evidence (Hand of Glory discharge) didn't match her capabilities.

          Lesson: Check alibis first. Physical evidence over circumstantial evidence.
          Don't let "she was there" override "but she arrived after it happened."

          *gestures at the frost pattern evidence*

          MOODY: "This curse signature is from a Hand of Glory—a dark wizard artifact.
          House-elf magic doesn't work that way. They can't channel dark objects like

          Student testimony places Draco at the scene during the attack. I saw him returning

          Lesson: Motive alone isn't enough. You need means, motive, AND opportunity.

        teaching_moment: |
          You committed "appeal to motive" fallacy: assuming someone is guilty because
          they had a reason to want the crime to happen.

          Dobby had motive (Snape caught him stealing), but he lacked MEANS (house-elf
          magic can't produce Hand of Glory discharge) and OPPORTUNITY (wasn't at the
          scene during the attack).

          Draco had all three: MEANS (Hand of Glory from his father), MOTIVE (caught
          experimenting with it), and OPPORTUNITY (placed at scene by timeline and witnesses).

          Lesson: Motive + Means + Opportunity = guilty. Motive alone = not enough.

          knew she was in the Restricted Section, and thought 'she found the body, she must
          have done it.' Classic mistake, recruit.

          Check the TIMELINE. Hermione entered the Restricted Section at 10:05 PM. Snape
          was attacked at 10:00 PM. She arrived five minutes AFTER he was already frozen.
          Her badge fell when she discovered the body and panicked—that's witness behavior,
          not criminal behavior.

          Yes, she was breaking rules (researching spells for Neville without permission).
          But breaking school rules isn't the same as attacking a professor. You conflated
          two separate violations.

          The physical evidence—Hand of Glory discharge—doesn't match Hermione. She doesn't
          own one. Student testimony places DRACO MALFOY at the scene with a wrapped object.
          I saw Draco returning at 10:15 PM, terrified. His father's letter confirms he
          received the Hand of Glory.

          You let circumstantial evidence (her badge) override physical evidence (Hand of

          First: MEANS. The curse signature is from a Hand of Glory—a dark wizard artifact.
          House-elf magic can't channel those objects. They work entirely differently. Dobby
          couldn't produce that frost pattern even if he tried.

          Second: TIMELINE. Dobby stole ingredients THREE DAYS before Snape's attack. The
          note you found was written days earlier. Separate crime, separate timeline.

          Third: OPPORTUNITY. Dobby has an alibi. After the attack, he came to McGonagall
          in tears, confessing the theft. She can confirm his whereabouts.

          You focused on MOTIVE (Dobby had conflict with Snape) and ignored MEANS and
          OPPORTUNITY. That's 'appeal to motive' fallacy—assuming someone's guilty because
          they had a reason, without checking if they could physically do it.

          The real culprit is Draco Malfoy: Hand of Glory from his father (letter evidence),
          placed at scene by student testimony, seen returning by me at 10:15 PM looking
          guilty as sin. Draco had all three: means, motive, and opportunity.

      MOODY: "Get out there and investigate. Talk to the witnesses. Examine the crime scene.
      Find the physical evidence. Build a timeline. Then come back and tell me who did this—
      and prove it with EVIDENCE, not hunches.

      And recruit? Don't trust anyone. Not the clever one. Not the scared one. Not even the
      innocent-looking one. Trust the evidence. Trust the timeline. Trust logic.

      **CONSTANT VIGILANCE.**"

    case_overview: |
      Snape frozen by Hand of Glory curse in Restricted Section at 10:00 PM. Hermione
      found body at 10:05 PM. Draco Malfoy seen fleeing, returned at 10:15 PM. McGonagall
      witnessed his return. Physical evidence (Hand of Glory discharge, Lucius's letter)
      points to Draco. Dobby stole ingredients days earlier (red herring). Hermione broke
      rules (teaching Neville) but didn't attack Snape. Timeline and physical evidence
      prove Draco guilty of reckless use of dark artifact resulting in accidental harm.
