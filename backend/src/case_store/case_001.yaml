        motionless, wand clutched in hand.

            The spell residue confirms the victim attempted to defend themselves moments before being incapacitated.

            from outside the room. Someone was watching.
            The geometric precision of the spiral suggests a skilled caster, not accidental magic.

            I saw Draco Malfoy near the window at 9:00pm. He was casting
            something - the frost pattern on the glass looked just like his

  solution:

      - "Frost pattern on window matches Draco's wand signature (freezing charm cast from outside)"

        - "Her defensive behavior during interrogation seems suspicious"

      confrontation:
        - speaker: "moody"
          text: "Well done, recruit. The frost pattern, the timing, the testimony - it all points to one person. Time to face the music, Mr. Malfoy."
        - speaker: "draco"
          text: "I... I didn't mean for it to go this far. I just wanted to scare them. They were going to tell everyone about the exams. My father would have been furious."
          tone: "broken"
        - speaker: "moody"
          text: "Intent matters little when harm is done. The evidence speaks for itself - your freezing charm cast from outside that window."
        - speaker: "draco"
          text: "I panicked when I saw them through the window. They had proof. I thought if I could just... freeze them in place... but the spell was too strong."
          tone: "remorseful"
        - speaker: "moody"
          text: "The Ministry will decide your fate now. Good work, recruit. You followed the evidence where it led."
      aftermath: |
        Draco Malfoy was taken into custody pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic.
        His wand was confiscated and examined, confirming the freezing charm residue matched
        the pattern on the library window. The victim made a full recovery after treatment
        at the Hospital Wing. Draco faced expulsion proceedings and his father's considerable
        influence couldn't shield him from the evidence. Hermione Granger was cleared of any
        involvement and commended for her honest testimony.

    incorrect:
      - suspect_accused: "hermione"
        reveal: |
          Hermione Granger was innocent. The actual culprit was Draco Malfoy.
          The frost pattern on the window was cast FROM OUTSIDE - Hermione was inside
          the library. Her wand signature shows no freezing charms, only study-related spells.
        teaching_moment: |
          You fell for confirmation bias - focusing on Hermione's presence in the library
          while ignoring the critical evidence: the frost pattern was cast from OUTSIDE
          the window. Always check the direction and origin of magical evidence.

  mentor_feedback_templates:
    fallacies:
      confirmation_bias:
        description: "You focused only on evidence supporting your theory while ignoring contradictory evidence."
        example: "You emphasized {suspect}'s presence but dismissed the frost pattern origin which contradicted your conclusion."
      correlation_not_causation:
        description: "You assumed two events happening together means one caused the other."
        example: "Just because {suspect} was present doesn't mean they committed the crime. Presence does not equal guilt."
      authority_bias:
        description: "You trusted testimony without verifying it against physical evidence."
        example: "You believed {witness}'s statement without checking if the magical evidence supported it."
      post_hoc:
        description: "You assumed event A caused event B just because A happened first."
        example: "Just because {suspect} argued with the victim earlier doesn't prove they're guilty of this crime."
      weak_reasoning:
        description: "Your reasoning lacks conviction and evidence. 'I guess' is not a deduction."
        example: "Speculation without supporting evidence is worthless in an investigation. State facts, not feelings."

    reasoning_quality:
      excellent: "Outstanding deduction. You cited all key evidence and avoided logical fallacies. The frost pattern origin was correctly identified."
      good: "Solid reasoning. You identified most key evidence but missed {missed_point}."
      fair: "Your conclusion is correct, but your reasoning had gaps. You should have considered {point}."
      poor: "You reached the right answer but for the wrong reasons. Review the evidence chain more carefully."
      failing: "Your reasoning contains multiple fallacies: {fallacy_list}. The evidence tells a different story."

      hermione: |
        MOODY: "Granger? The BOOKWORM? Let me guess: she was there, she borrowed a
        restricted book, she seemed nervous. So she must be guilty, right?

        WRONG. Check the FROST PATTERN, recruit. It was cast from OUTSIDE the window.
        Granger was INSIDE the library. Her wand shows no freezing charms - only study spells.

        You've got CONFIRMATION BIAS written all over this accusation. Being present
        doesn't make someone guilty. Think about WHERE the spell came from.

    teaching_question:
      prompt: |
        Before you start, recruit - a question:

        Out of 100 school incidents ruled "accidents," how many actually ARE accidents?

      choices:
        - id: "25_percent"
          text: "25%"
          response: |
            *eye narrows* Too low. You're being paranoid. Not everything's a conspiracy.
            85% ARE accidents. Hogwarts is dangerous - staircases move, potions explode.

        - id: "50_percent"
          text: "50%"
          response: |
            Not quite. You're guessing, not deducing.
            85% ARE accidents. Start with what's LIKELY, then let evidence move you.

        - id: "85_percent"
          text: "85%"
          response: |
            *nods* Correct. 85%. Hogwarts is dangerous. Most accidents ARE accidents.
            START THERE. Don't chase dramatic theories before ruling out the obvious.

        - id: "almost_all"
          text: "Almost all (95%+)"
          response: |
            Close, but overcorrecting. 85% is the number.
            Base rates matter - start with likely scenarios, not rare conspiracies.

      concept_summary: |
        That's base rates, recruit. Always start with what's LIKELY,
        then let evidence move you. Not the other way around. Now investigate.

    rationality_concept: "base_rates"
    concept_description: "Start with likely scenarios (base rates), not dramatic theories. Let evidence update your priors."

    transition: |
      *Mad-Eye Moody's magical eye spins*

      CONSTANT VIGILANCE, recruit. The library awaits. Question everyone.
      Trust no one. The evidence will tell you the truth - if you're smart
      enough to find it. Now GO.
